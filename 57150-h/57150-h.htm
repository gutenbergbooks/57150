<small>RIVERS OF LIFE.</small></h2>


<p>The lines of development of the religious faiths of
mankind have been aptly termed by Major-General
Forlong “Rivers of Life.” The streams of faiths are
marvellously depicted by this writer in a chart which
shows “the rise and fall of the various religious ideas,
mythologies, and rites which have at any time prevailed
among nations.” This chart ingeniously shows, moreover,
“the degrees of intensity manifested at stated
periods by any particular wave of doctrine or worship,
and the mode in which the tributary streams of mythological
or theological thought become in turn absorbed
in the central River of Life.” The views adopted by
General Forlong have much in common with those
embodied in the works of Godfrey Higgins and some
later writers, but they have a special value as being
based on personal observation. The author of “Rivers
of Life” had the inestimable advantage of being admitted
to shrines and of receiving instructions in sacred
mysteries which are generally closed to European
inquirers, and of having made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span> “a diligent exploration
of ruined temples, pillars, and mounds, and all such
traces of a primitive symbolism, which lie scattered
over the East and West, as religious fossils underlying
the superficial crust of theological strata.”</p>

<p>Rivers of religious life have a beginning, like other
streams, and what are the sources to which man’s
primitive faiths may be traced? The early “symbolic
objects of man’s adoration” are arranged by General
Forlong in the following order: First, Tree; 2nd,
Phallic; 3rd, Serpent; 4th, Fire; 5th, Sun; 6th,
Ancestral. The first “breathings of the human soul”
were manifested under the sacred tree or grove,
whose refreshing shade is so highly valued in the East.
All nations, particularly the Aryan peoples, have considered
tree-planting a sacred duty, and the grove was
man’s first temple, “and became a sanctuary, asylum,
or place of refuge, and as time passed on, temples
came to be built in the sacred groves.” If tree-worship
had such an origin as this, its origin ought to be shown
in the ideas associated with it. What, then, are those
ideas? General Forlong, after referring to Dr. Fergusson’s
statement that the tree and serpent are
symbolised in every religious system which the world
has known, says that the two together are typical of
the reproductive powers of vegetable and animal life.
The connection between tree and serpent-worship is
often so intimate that we may expect one to throw
light on the other. The Aryans generally may be
called “tree-worshippers,” and according to Fergusson
they as a rule destroyed serpents and serpent-worshipping
races. Yet at Athens and near Rome both
those faiths flourished together, as they appear to have
done also in many parts of Western Asia. They are
intimately associated with religious notions of many
Buddhist peoples. This is shown curiously in the
early legends of Kambodia. These are said by General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
Forlong to present two striking features. First, a
holy tree, which the kingly race, who came to this
serpent country, reposed under, or descended from
heaven by; secondly, that this tree-loving race are captivated
by the dragon princess of the land. It is the
serpent king, however, who builds the city of <i>Nakon
Thom</i> for his daughter and her stranger husband. It
is not improbable that Buddhism originated among a
people who were both tree and serpent-worshippers,
although the former became more intimately and at
an earlier period associated with its founder.</p>

<p>Let us now see what ideas are symbolised by the
serpent. We are told that he is “an emblem of the
Sun, Time, Kronos, and Eternity.” The serpent was,
indeed, the Sun-God, or spirit of the sun, and therefore
Power, Wisdom, Light, and a fit type of creation and
generative power. Dr. Donaldson came to the conclusion
that the serpent has always a Phallic significance,
a remark which exactly accords with General
Forlong’s experience, “founded simply upon <i>close
observation</i> in Eastern lands, and conclusions drawn
by himself, unaided by books or teachers, from thousands
of stories and conversations with Eastern priests
and people.” The testimony of a competent and
honest observer is all important, and we must believe
when we are told that the serpent, or the constant
early attendant on the Lingam, is the special symbol
which veils the actual God. The same may be said,
indeed, of Tree Worship, and as tree-worship and
serpent-worship embrace the Phallic faith, the first
three streams of faiths are represented by them. It
is evident, however, that Phallic ideas are at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
foundation of both tree and serpent-worship, and the
Phallic stream of faith should be given the first place as
the actual source of the Rivers of Life. General Forlong
does, indeed, affirm that Phallic worship enters so
closely into union with <i>all</i> faiths to the present hour
that it is impossible to keep it out of view. We can
well understand how this should be as to the tree,
serpent, and solar cults, but it is not so evident at first
sight in relation to fire-worship. If fire was, however,
regarded as the servant of Siva, and all creating gods,
there is no difficulty in accepting the position. The
object of the worship offered to the sacred fire is consistent
with that view. Thus Greeks, Romans, and
Hindoos “besought Agni by fervent prayers for increase
of flocks and families, for happy lives and serene
old age, for wisdom and pardon from sin.” General
Forlong appears to see in the worship of fire essentially
a household faith, and this was undoubtedly so
if his explanation of the Lares and Penates is correct.
These symbols represented “the <i>past</i> vital fire or energy
of the tribe, as the patriarch, his stalwart sons and
daughters did that of the <i>present</i> living fire the sacred
hearth.” General Forlong states, indeed, that everything
relating to blood used to be connected with fire,
and he supposed, therefore, that <i>agnatio</i> may have
been <i>relation by fire</i>, for the <i>agnati</i> can only be those of
the fire or father’s side.</p>

<p>If the father derived his authority in the household
from the sacred hearth-fire, we can understand why
General Forlong has assigned to ancestor-worship the
last place in his scheme. He says, moreover, that
ancestor-worship is “a development and sequence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
that idiosyncracy of man which has led him to worship
and deify even the living—that which, according to
the teaching of Euemerus, accounts for all the mythological
tales of the gods and god-like men of Greece.”
The ancestor was worshipped in the great chief, the
Father of Fathers, each of whom was worshipped in the
<i>Dii Gentiles</i> of his own class, and this not only during
the comparatively modern Roman sway, but during the
ages of serpent, fire, and solar faiths. In the still earlier
faiths he was represented in the rude pillar, as well as
in the little Lares and Penates of the hearths. In this
case, however, ancestor-worship would seem to be
entitled to stand on the same level as tree-worship
and serpent-worship as a phase of the Phallic faith.
In fact, it is in a sense identified with serpent-worship.
General Forlong remarks that among the Greeks and
Romans “the ancestor came to be honoured and worshipped
only as the Generator, and so also the serpent
as his symbol.” This agrees with the conclusion I have
elsewhere endeavoured to establish, that the serpent
is really regarded as the representative of the ancestor,
in which case ancestor-worship is a very primitive
faith, although, in a specialised form, it may possibly,
as asserted by General Forlong, come later than fire-worship.</p>

<p>It can hardly now be doubted that the same ideas
underlie all the early faiths. This view is entertained
by General Forlong, who says:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span> “So imperceptibly
arose the serpent on pure Phallic faiths, fire on these,
and sun on all, and so intimately did all blend with one
another, that even in the ages of true history it was
often impossible to descry the exact God alluded to.”
The foundations of all those faiths, and of ancestor-worship
as allied to them, must therefore be sought in
the ideas entertained by mankind in the earliest times,
“when the races lived untaught, herded with their
cattle, and had as their sole object in life the multiplication
of these and of themselves.” The question
arises, however, whether the simple faith which man
then entertained was the earliest he had evolved.
General Forlong answers this question in the negative,
for he says, then referring to the serpent Buddhism of
Kambodia, that “Fetish worship was the <i>first</i> worship,
and to a great extent is still the <i>real</i> faith of the
ignorant, especially about these parts.” He finds that
nearly one quarter of the world yet deifies, or at least
reverences, sticks and stones, rams’ horns and charms,
a practice not unknown even to later faiths. The
fundamental belief which furnishes the key to those
phenomena, as well as to the animal-worship which is
so closely associated with one or other of the great
faith streams, should not be lost sight of. Jacob
Grimm pointed out, in his “Teutonic Mythology,”<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
that all nature was thought of by the heathen Germans
as living. Gods and men transformed themselves into
trees, plants, or beasts; spirits and elements attained
animal forms; and therefore we cannot wonder at the
heavenly bodies, and even day and night, summer and
winter, being actually personified. These ideas lend
themselves as well to fetishism as to sun-worship, and
all the ancient faiths alike may justly, therefore, be
regarded as phases of one universal nature-worship.
Mankind prays only for that which is thought good,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
and if one man seeks to obtain his desire through the
agency of a stick or a stone, and another through a
serpent or planetary god, the difference between them
is purely objective. The prayers which were offered
to the Vedic gods would be equally appropriate in the
mouth of a native of Western Africa. They had
relation simply to temporal needs, and were, says
Mr. Talboys Wheeler,<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> for plenty of rain, abundant
harvests, and prolific cattle, for bodily vigour, long
life, numerous offspring, and protection against all foes
and robbers. Moreover, the observances of the more
advanced faiths have little practical difference from
the fetishist. All alike have for their object the compelling
the good countenance, or counteracting the evil
designs, of the gods or spirits, and the real difference
is to be sought in the symbols under which they are
represented. Thus the Vedic Aryans regarded their
deified abstractions as personified with human wants,
and invoked them with rites which “may have formed
an accompaniment to every meal, and may have been
regarded almost as a part of the cooking.” Mr. Wheeler
adds<a id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span> “Sometimes a deity is supposed to be
attracted by the grateful sound of the stone and mortar
by which the <i>soma</i> juice was expressed from the plant,
or by the musical noise of the churning sticks by which
the wine was apparently stirred up and mixed with
curds; and the eager invokers implore the god not to
turn aside to the dwelling of any other worshipper,
but to come to them only, and drink the libation
which they had prepared, and reserve for them all his
favours and benefits.”</p>

<small>PHALLISM IN ANCIENT RELIGIONS.</small></h2>


<p>Dr. Faber, when treating of the ancient mysteries
in opposition to Bishop Warburton’s views of their
original purity, says:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span> “Long before the time of
Apuleius, whom he (Warburton) would describe as
quitting the impure orgies of the Syrian Goddess for
the blameless initiations of Isis, did the Phallic processions,
if we may credit Herodotus and Diodorus,
form a most conspicuous and essential part, not only
of the mysteries in general, but of these identical Isiac
or Osiric mysteries in particular. Nor is there any
reason to doubt their accuracy on this point. The
same detestable rites prevailed in Palestine among the
votaries of Siton, or Adonis, or Baal-Peor, long before
the exodus of Israel from Egypt. The same also,
anterior at least to the days of Herodotus, in Babylonia,
Cyprus, and Lydia. The same likewise from
the most remote antiquity in the mountains of
Armenia, among the worshippers of the great mother
Anais; and the same, from the very first institution
of their theological system, as we may fairly argue
from the uniform general establishment of this peculiar
superstition, among the Celtic Druids both of Britain
and of Ireland. Nor do we find such orgies less prevalent
in Hindostan. Every part of the theology of
that country ... is inseparably blended with them,
and replete with allusions to their fictitious origin.”<a id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>
It will not be necessary for me to give details of the
rites by which the Phallic superstition is distinguished,
as they may be found in the works of Dulaure,<a id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
Richard Payne Knight,<a id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> and many other writers. I
shall refer to them, therefore, only so far as may be
required for the due understanding of the subject to be
considered, the influence of the Phallic idea in the religions
of antiquity. The first step in the inquiry is to
ascertain the origin of the superstition in question.
Faber ingeniously referred to a primitive universal belief
in a Great Father, the curious connection seen to exist between
nearly all non-Christian mythologies, and he saw
in Phallic worship a degradation of this belief. Such an
explanation as this, however, is not satisfactory, since not
only does it require the assumption of a primitive divine
revelation, but proof is still wanting that all peoples
have, or ever had, any such notion of a great parent of
mankind as that supposed to have been revealed.
And yet there is a valuable germ of truth in this
hypothesis. The Phallic superstition is founded
essentially in the family idea. Captain Richard
Burton recognised this truth when he asserted that
“amongst all barbarians whose primal want is progeny,
we observe a greater or less development of the
Phallic worship.”<a id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> This view, however, is imperfect.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
There must have been something more than a mere
desire for progeny to lead primitive man to view the
generative process with the peculiar feelings embodied
in this superstition. We are, in fact, here taken to
the root of all religions—awe at the mysterious and
unknown. That which the uncultured mind cannot
understand is viewed with dread or veneration, as it
may be, and the object presenting the mysterious
phenomenon may itself be worshipped as a fetish or
the residence of a presiding spirit. But there is
nothing more mysterious than the phenomena of
generation, and nothing more important than the final
result of the generative act. Reflection on this result
would naturally cause that which led to it to be
invested with a certain degree of superstitious significance.
The feeling generated would have a double
object, as it had a double origin—wonder at the phenomenon
itself and a perception of the value of its
consequences. The former, which is the most simple,
would lead to a veneration for the organs whose
operation conduced to the phenomena, hence the
superstitious practices connected with the phallus and
the yoni among primitive peoples. In this, moreover,
we have the explanation of numerous curious facts
observed among Eastern nations. Such is the respect
shown by women for the generative organ of dervishes
and fakirs. Such also is the Semitic custom
referred to in the Hebrew Scriptures as the putting of
the hand under the thigh, which is explained by the
Talmudists to be the touching of that part of the body
which is sealed and made holy by circumcision; a
custom which was, up to a recent date, still in use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
among the Arabs as the most solemn guarantee of
truthfulness.<a id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>The second phase of the Phallic superstition is that
which arises from a perception of the value of the
consequences of the act of generation. The distinction
between this and the preceding phase is that,
while the one has relation to the organs engaged, the
other refers more particularly to the chief agent.
Thus the father of the family is venerated as the
generator, and his authority is founded altogether on
the act and consequences of generation. We thus see
the fundamental importance, as well as the Phallic
origin, of the family idea. From this has sprung the
social organisation of all primitive peoples. An instance
in point may be derived from Mr. Hunter’s
account of the Santals of Bengal. He says that the
classification of this interesting people among themselves
depends “not upon social rank or occupation,
but upon the family basis.” This is shown by the
character of the six great ceremonies in a Santal’s life,
which are, “admission into the family; admission into
the tribe; admission into the race; union of his own
tribe with another by marriage; formal dismission
from the living race by incremation; lastly, a reunion
with the departed fathers.”<a id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> We may judge
from this of the character of certain customs which
are widespread among primitive peoples, and the
Phallic origin of which has long since been lost sight
of. The value set on the results of the generative act
would naturally make the arrival at the age of puberty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
an event of peculiar significance. Hence we find
various ceremonies performed among primitive, and
even among civilised peoples, at this period of life.
Often when the youth arrives at manhood other rites
are performed to mark the significance of the event.
Marriage, too, derives an importance which it would
not otherwise possess. Thus, among many peoples,
it is attended with certain ceremonies denoting its
object, or at least marking it as an event of peculiar
significance in the life of the individual or even in the
history of the tribe. The marriage ceremonial is
especially fitted for the use of Phallic rites or symbolism,
the former among semi-civilised peoples often
being simply the act of consummation itself, which
appears to be looked on as part of the ceremony.
The symbolism we have ourselves retained to the present
day in the wedding-ring, which had undoubtedly
a Phallic origin, if, as appears probable, it originated
in the Samothracian mysteries.<a id="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> Nor does the influence
of the Phallic idea end with life. The veneration
entertained for the father of the family, as the
“generator,” led in time to peculiar care being taken
of the bodies of the dead, and finally to the worship
of ancestors, which, under one form or another, distinguished
all the civilised nations of antiquity, as it
does even now most of the peoples of the heathen
world.</p>

<p>There is one Phallic rite which, from its wide range,
is of peculiar importance. I refer to circumcision.
The origin of this custom has not yet, so far as I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
aware, been satisfactorily explained. The idea that,
under certain climatic conditions, circumcision is
necessary for cleanliness and comfort,<a id="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> does not appear
to be well founded, as the custom is not universal,
even within the tropics. Nor is the reason given by
Captain Richard Burton, in his “Notes connected
with the Dahoman,” for both circumcision and excision,
perfectly satisfactory. The real origin of these
customs has been forgotten by all peoples practising
them, and therefore they have ceased to have their
primitive significance. That circumcision at least
had a superstitious origin may be inferred from the
traditional history of the Jews. The old Hebrew
writers, persistent in their idea that they were a
peculiar people, chosen by God for a special purpose,
asserted that this rite was instituted by Jehovah as
a sign of the covenant between Him and Abraham.
Although we cannot doubt that this rite was practised
by the Egyptians and Phœnicians<a id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> long before the
birth of Abraham, yet two points connected with the
Hebrew tradition are noticeable. These are, the
religious significance of the act of circumcision—it is
the sign of a covenant between God and man—and
its performance by the head of the family. These
two things are indeed intimately connected; since,
in the patriarchal age, the father was always the priest
of the family, the officer of the sacrifices. We have
it on the authority of the Veda that this was the case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
also among the primitive Aryan people.<a id="FNanchor_13_13" href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> Abraham,
therefore, as the father and priest of the family, performed
the religious ceremony of circumcision on the
males of his household.</p>

<p>Circumcision, in its inception, is a purely Phallic
rite,<a id="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> having for its aim the marking of that which
from its associations is viewed with peculiar veneration,
and it connects the two phases of this superstition,
which have for their objects respectively the <i>instrument</i>
of generation and the <i>agent</i>. We are thus brought back
to the consideration of the simplest form of Phallic
worship, that which has for its object the generative
organs, viewed as the mysterious instruments in the
realisation of that keen desire for children which
distinguishes all primitive peoples. This feeling is so
nearly universal that it is a matter of surprise to find
the act by which it is expressed stigmatised as sinful.
Yet such is the case, although the incidents in which
the fact is embodied are so veiled in figure that their
true meaning has long been forgotten. Clemens
Alexandrinus tells us that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span> “the bacchanals hold their
orgies in honour of the frenzied Bacchus, celebrating
their sacred frenzy by the eating of raw flesh, and go
through the distribution of the parts of butchered
victims, crowned with snakes, shrieking out the name
of that Eva by whom error came into the world.”
He adds that “the symbol of the Bacchic orgies is a
consecrated serpent,” and that, “according to the
strict interpretation of the Hebrew term, the name
Hevia, aspirated, signifies a <i>female serpent</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_15_15" href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> We have
here a reference to the supposed fall of man from
pristine “innocence,” Eve and the serpent being very
significantly introduced in close conjunction, and
indeed becoming in some sense identified with each
other. In fact, the Arabic word for serpent, <i>hayyat</i>,
may be said also to mean “life,” and in this sense the
legendary, first human mother is called Eve or <i>Chevvah</i>,
in Arabic <i>hawwa</i>. In its relations, as an asserted fact,
the question of the fall has an important bearing on
the subject before us. Quite irrespective of the impossibility
of accepting the Mosaic Cosmogony as a
divinely-inspired account of the origin of the world
and man—a cosmogony which, with those of all other
Semitic peoples, has a purely “Phallic” basis<a id="FNanchor_16_16" href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>—the
whole transaction said to have taken place in the
Garden of Eden is fraught with difficulties on the
received interpretation. The very idea on which it is
founded—the placing by God in the way of Eve of a
temptation which he knew she could not resist—is
sufficient to throw discredit on the ordinary reading
of the narrative. The effect, indeed, that was to
follow the eating of the forbidden fruit appears to an
ordinary mind to furnish the most praiseworthy motive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
for not obeying the commandment to abstain. That
the “eating of the forbidden fruit” was simply a figurative
mode of expressing the performance of the act
necessary to the perpetuation of the human race—an
act which in its origin was thought to be the source of
all evil—is evident from the consequences which
followed and from the curse entailed.<a id="FNanchor_17_17" href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> As to the
curse inflicted on Eve, it has always been a stumbling
block in the way of commentators. For what connection
is there between the eating of a fruit and
sorrow in bringing forth children? The meaning is
evident, however, when we know that conception and
child-bearing were the direct consequences of the act
forbidden. How far this meaning was intended by
the compiler of the Mosaic books we shall see
further on.</p>

<p>The central feature of the Mosaic legend of the
“fall” is the reference to the tree of knowledge or
wisdom. It is now generally supposed that the forbidden
fruit was a kind of <i>citrus</i>,<a id="FNanchor_18_18" href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> but certain facts
connected with <i>aborolatry</i> clearly show this opinion to
be erroneous. Among peoples in the most opposite
regions of the world various species of the fig-tree are
considered sacred. In almost every part of Africa
the <i>banyan</i> is viewed with a special veneration.
Livingstone noticed this among the tribes on the Zambesi
and the Shire,<a id="FNanchor_19_19" href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> and he says that the banyan is
looked upon with veneration all the way from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
Barotse to Loanda, and thought to be a preservative
from evil.<a id="FNanchor_20_20" href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> Du Chaillu states that in almost every
Ishogo and Ashango village he visited in Western
Equatorial Africa there was a large <i>ficus</i> “standing
about the middle of the main street, and near the
mbuiti or idol-house of the village.” The tree is
sacred, and if it dies the village is at once abandoned.<a id="FNanchor_21_21" href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>
Captain Tuckey found the same thing on the Congo,
where he says the <i>ficus religiosa</i> is considered sacred.<a id="FNanchor_22_22" href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>
Again, according to Caillié, at Mouriosso, in Western
Central Africa, the market was held under a tree,
which, from his description, must have been the
banyan, and he noticed the same thing in other towns.<a id="FNanchor_23_23" href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>
It is evident from Dr. Barth’s “Travels in Central
Africa,” that superstitious regard for certain trees is
found throughout the whole of the region he traversed,
and among some tribes the fig-tree occupies this
position. Thus, he says, “the sacred grove of the
village of Isge was formed by magnificent trees,
mostly of the <i>ficus</i> tribe.”<a id="FNanchor_24_24" href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> Nor is this superstition
unknown among other dark races of the Southern
Hemisphere. A species of the fig-tree is planted by
the New Zealanders close to the temples of their
gods. The superstition is traceable, according to
Mr. Earle, even among the aborigines of Northern
Australia, certain peculiar notions connected with the
banyan tree being common to the inhabitants of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
Coburg Peninsula and of the Indian Islands.<a id="FNanchor_25_25" href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> Mr. Marsden
met with this superstition among the Sumatrans,
and we learn from Mr. Wallace that in one of the
towns of Eastern Java the market is held under the
branches of a tree allied to the sacred fig-tree.<a id="FNanchor_26_26" href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> If we
turn to India, we find that while the banyan is venerated
by the Brahmans, it is the bo-tree which is held sacred
by many of the followers of Gautama Buddha. This
may be because, under the name of the <i>Pilpel</i>, it was
the peculiar tree of the first recorded Buddha, of
whom Gautama was supposed by his disciples to be
an incarnation. Both of these trees belong to the
genus <i>ficus</i>, and it is curious that, although probably
in consequence of Semitic influence, the <i>ficus sycamorus</i>
was the sacred tree in ancient Egypt, of which it was
the symbol, its place appears ultimately to have been
taken by the banyan (<i>ficus indica</i>),<a id="FNanchor_27_27" href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> so highly venerated
in other parts of Africa. Now, what is the explanation
of the peculiar character ascribed to these trees
by peoples who must, on any hypothesis, have been
separated for thousands of years? The bo-tree of the
Buddhists itself derived a more sacred character from
its encircling the palm—the Palmyra Palm being the
<i>kalpa-tree</i>, or “tree of life,” of the Hindu paradise.<a id="FNanchor_28_28" href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>
The Buddhists term this connection “the bo-tree
united in marriage with the palm.” The Phallic significance
of the palm is well known, and in its connection
with the bo-tree we have the perfect idea of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
generative activity, the combining of the male and
female organs, a combination intended by the Hebrew
legend when it speaks of the tree of life, and also of
“the knowledge of good and evil.”<a id="FNanchor_29_29" href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> “The palm-tree,”
says Dr. Inman, “is figured on ancient coins alone, or
associated with some feminine emblem. It typified
the male creator, who was represented as an upright
stone, a pillar, a round tower, a tree stump, an oak-tree,
a pine-tree, a maypole, a spire, an obelisk, a
minaret, and the like.”<a id="FNanchor_30_30" href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> As we have just seen, the
Palmyra Palm is the <i>kalpa-tree</i>, or the “tree of life”
of the Hindu paradise, and this was not the only
kind of tree with which the idea of life was thus
associated.</p>

<p>In the mythologies of more northern peoples the
place of the palm is supplied by the more stately, if
less upright, oak. The patriarch Jacob hid the idols
of his household under the oak near Shechem,<a id="FNanchor_31_31" href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> and
his descendants afterwards made burnt offerings under
every thick oak.<a id="FNanchor_32_32" href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> Among the Greeks and Romans
this tree was sacred to Zeus, or Jupiter, the Father
of Gods and men. With the Russians, the Prussians,
and the Germans, the oak was equally sacred. The
sacred oak was the form under which the Druids
worshipped the Supreme Being <i>Hæsus</i>, or Mighty.
According to Davies,<a id="FNanchor_33_33" href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> it was symbolised by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
letter D, which forms the consonantal sound of the
word denoting God in many languages, as it does of
the name of the mythical father <i>Ad</i>, of the Adamic
stock of mankind. In Teutonic mythology the great
oak forms the roof-tree of the Volsung’s hall, spreading
its branches far and wide in the upper air, being the
counterpart, says Mr. Cox, of the mighty Yggdrasil.<a id="FNanchor_34_34" href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>
This is the gigantic ash-tree, whose branches embrace
the whole world, and which is thought to be only
another form of the colossal Irminsul. Mr. Cox
observes on this: “The tree and pillar are thus alike
seen in the columns, whether of Herakles or of
Roland; while the cosmogonic character of the myth
is manifest in the legend of the primeval Askr, the
offspring of the ash-tree, of which Virgil, from the
characteristic which probably led to its selection,
speaks as stretching its roots as far down into earth as
its branches soar towards heaven.”<a id="FNanchor_35_35" href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> The name of the
Teutonic Askr is also that of the Iranian <i>Meschia</i>,<a id="FNanchor_36_36" href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>
and the ash, therefore, must be identified with the
tree from which springs the primeval man of the
Zarathustrian cosmogony.<a id="FNanchor_37_37" href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> So Sigmund of the Volsung
Tale is drawn from the trunk of a poplar tree,<a id="FNanchor_38_38" href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a>
which thus occupies the same position as the ash and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
the oak as a “tree of life.” The poplar was, indeed,
a sacred tree among many nations of antiquity. This
may, doubtless, be explained by reference to its
“habit,” which much resembles that of the sacred
Indian fig-tree, with which the trembling movement,
as well as the shape, of its leaves have caused it to be
thus compared.</p>

<p>That the ideas symbolised by the various sacred
trees of antiquity originated, however, with the fig-tree
is extremely probable. No other tree has been
so widely venerated as this. The sycamore (<i>ficus
sycamorus</i>) was sacred to Netpe, the mother of Osiris,
whose statue was generally made of its wood. In
relation to that subject, Sir Gardner Wilkinson says:<a id="FNanchor_39_39" href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>
“The Athenians had a holy fig-tree, which grew on
the ‘sacred road,’ where, during the celebration of
the Eleusinian mysteries, the procession which went
from Athens to Eleusis halted. This was on the sixth
day of the ceremony, called Jacchus, in honour of the
son of Jupiter and Ceres, who accompanied his mother
in search of Proserpine; but the fig-tree of Athens
does not appear to have been borrowed from the
sycamore of Egypt, unless it were in consequence of
its connection with the mother of Osiris and Isis,
whom they supposed to correspond to Ceres and
Bacchus.”<a id="FNanchor_40_40" href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> According to Plutarch, a basket of figs
formed one of the chief things carried in the processions
in honour of Bacchus, and the sacred phallus,
like the statue of Priapus, appears to have been
generally made of the wood of the fig-tree.<a id="FNanchor_41_41" href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
facts well show the nature of the ideas which had
come to be connected with that tree. To what has
been already said may, however, be added the testimony
of a French writer, who, after speaking of the
<i>lotus</i> as one of the many symbols anciently used to
represent the productive forces of nature, continues:
“Il faut y joindre, pour le règne végétal, le figuier
indien, ou l’arbre des Banians, le figuier sacré ou
religieux (ficus indica, bengalensis, ficus religiosa, &amp;c.),
<i>vata</i>, <i>aswatha</i>, <i>pipala</i>, et bien d’autres, idéalisés de
bonne heure, dans le mythologie des Hindous, sous la
figure de l’arbre de vie, arbre immense, colonne de
feu, énorme et orgueilleux phallus, l’abord unique,
mais depuis devisé et dispersé, et qui n’est peut-être
pas sans rapport, soit avec l’arbre de la connaissance
du bien et du mal, soit avec d’autres symboles non
moins fameux.”<a id="FNanchor_42_42" href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>That the <i>ficus</i> was the symbolical tree “in the
midst of the garden” of the Hebrew legend of the
fall is extremely probable. That notion would seem,
indeed, to be required by reference to the fig
leaves<a id="FNanchor_43_43" href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> as the covering used by Adam and Eve when,
after eating the forbidden fruit, they found themselves
to be naked. The fig-tree, moreover, meets
the difficulty in distinguishing between the tree of
life and the tree of knowledge. These, according to
the opinion above expressed, as to the meaning of the
“fall,” would represent the male and female principles,
as do the bo-tree and palm,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span> “united in marriage,”
of the Buddhists, the palm deriving more sacredness
from being encircled by the ficus. Probably, however,
the double symbol was of later introduction. The
banyan of itself would be sufficient to represent the
dual idea, when to the primitive one of “knowledge”
was added that of “life.” The stately trunk would
answer to the “tree of life,” while its fruit was the
symbol of that which was more especially affected by
the act of disobedience. This was the eating of the
fruit, which, as conveying the forbidden wisdom, is
evidently the essential feature of the legend, and the
<i>fig</i> had anciently just that symbolical meaning which
would be required for the purpose.<a id="FNanchor_44_44" href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> Throughout the
East, from the earliest historical period, the fruit of
the fig-tree was the emblem of virginity. Dr. Inman
says: “The fruit of the tree resembles in shape the
virgin uterus; with its stem attached, it symbolises
the <i>sistrum</i> of Isis. Its form led to the idea that
it would promote fertility. To this day, in Oriental
countries, the hidden meaning of the fig is almost as
well known as its commercial value.”<a id="FNanchor_45_45" href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>That we have in the Mosaic account of the “fall”
a Phallic legend, is evident also from the introduction
of the serpent on the scene, and the position it takes
as the inciting cause of the sinful act. We are here
reminded of the passage already quoted from Clemens
Alexandrinus, who tells us that the serpent was the
special symbol of the worship of Bacchus. Now
this animal holds a very curious place in the religions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
of the civilised peoples of antiquity. Although, in
consequence of the influence of later thought, it
came to be treated as the personification of evil, and
as such appears in the Hebrew legend of the fall, yet
originally the serpent was the special symbol of
wisdom and healing. In the latter capacity it appears
even in connection with the Exodus from
Egypt. It is, however, in its character as a symbol
of wisdom that it more especially claims our attention,
although these ideas are intimately connected—the
power of healing being merely a phase of wisdom.
From the earliest times of which we have any historical
notice the serpent has been connected with
the gods of wisdom. This animal was the especial
symbol of <i>Thoth</i> or <i>Taaut</i>, a primeval deity of Syro-Egyptian
mythology,<a id="FNanchor_46_46" href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> and of all those gods, such as
<i>Hermes</i> and <i>Seth</i>, who can be connected with him.
This is true also of the 3rd member of the Chaldean
triad, <i>Héa</i> or <i>Hoa</i>. According to Sir Henry Rawlinson,
the most important titles of this deity refer
“to his functions as the source of all knowledge and
science.” Not only is he “the intelligent fish,” but
his name may be read as signifying both “life” and
a “serpent,” and he may be considered as “figured by
the great serpent which occupies so conspicuous a
place among the symbols of the gods on the black
stones recording Babylonian benefactions.”<a id="FNanchor_47_47" href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> The
serpent was also the symbol of the Egyptian <i>Kneph</i>,
who resembled the <i>Sophia</i> of the Gnostics, the divine
wisdom. This animal, moreover, was the <i>Agatho<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>-dæmon</i>
of the religions of antiquity—the giver of happiness
and good fortune.<a id="FNanchor_48_48" href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> It was in these capacities,
rather than as having a Phallic significance, that
the serpent was associated with the sun-gods, the
Chaldean <i>Bel</i>, the Grecian <i>Apollo</i>, and the Semitic
<i>Seth</i>.</p>

<p>But whence originated the idea of the wisdom of
the serpent which led to its connection with the
legend of the “fall?” This may, perhaps, be explained
by other facts, which show also the nature of
the wisdom here intended. Thus, in the annals of
the Mexicans, the first woman, whose name was translated
by the old Spanish writers, “<i>the woman of our
flesh</i>,” is always represented as accompanied by a
great male serpent. This serpent is the sun-god
<i>Tonacatle-coatl</i>, the principal deity of the Mexican
Pantheon, while the goddess-mother of primitive man
is called <i>Cihua-Cohuatl</i>, which signifies “<i>woman of the
serpent</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_49_49" href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> According to this legend, which agrees
with that of other American tribes, a serpent must
have been the father of the human race. This notion
can be explained only on the supposition that the
serpent was thought to have had at one time a human
form. In the Hebrew legend the tempter speaks, and
“the old serpent having two feet,” of Persian mythology,
is none other than the evil spirit Ahriman him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>self.<a id="FNanchor_50_50" href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>
The fact is that the serpent was only a symbol,
or at most an embodiment of the spirit which it
represented, as we see from the belief of several
African and American tribes, which probably preserves
the primitive form of this superstition.
Serpents are looked upon by these peoples as embodiments
of their departed ancestors,<a id="FNanchor_51_51" href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> and an analogous
notion is entertained by various Hindoo tribes.
No doubt the noiseless movement and the activity of
the serpent, combined with its peculiar gaze and marvellous
power of fascination, led to its being viewed
as a spirit embodiment, and hence also as the possessor
of wisdom.<a id="FNanchor_52_52" href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> In the spirit character ascribed
to the serpent, we have the explanation of the association
of its worship with human sacrifice noted by
Mr. Fergusson—this sacrifice being really connected
with the worship of ancestors.</p>

<p>It is evident, moreover, that we find here the origin
of the idea of evil sometimes associated with the
Serpent-God. The Kafir and the Hindu, although he
treats with respect any serpent which may visit his
dwelling, yet entertains a suspicion of his visitant. It
may perhaps be the embodiment of an <i>evil</i> spirit, or
for some reason or other it may desire to injure <i>him</i>.
Mr. Fergusson states that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span> “the chief characteristic of
the serpents throughout the East in all ages seems to
have been their power over the wind and rain,” which
they gave or withheld according to their good or ill-will
towards man.<a id="FNanchor_53_53" href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> This notion is curiously confirmed
by the title given by the Egyptians to the Semitic God
<i>Seti</i> or <i>Seth</i>—<i>Typhon</i>, which was the name of the
Phœnician Evil principle, and also of a destructive
wind, thus having a curious analogy with the “Typhoon”
of the Chinese Seas.<a id="FNanchor_54_54" href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> When the notion of a
duality in nature was developed, there would be no
difficulty in applying it to the symbols or embodiments
by which the idea of wisdom was represented
in the animal world. Thus, there came to be not only
good, but also bad serpents, both of which are referred
to in the narrative of the Hebrew Exodus, but still
more clearly in the struggle between the good and the
bad serpents of Persian mythology, which symbolised
Ormuzd or Mithra and the Evil spirit Ahriman.<a id="FNanchor_55_55" href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> So
far as I can make out the serpent symbol has not a
<i>direct</i> Phallic reference, nor is its attribute of wisdom
the most essential. The idea most intimately associated
with this animal was that of <i>life</i>, not present
merely but continued and probably everlasting.<a id="FNanchor_56_56" href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> Thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
the snake <i>Bai</i> was figured as Guardian of the doorways
of those chambers of Egyptian Tombs which
represented the mansions of heaven.<a id="FNanchor_57_57" href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> A sacred
serpent would seem to have been kept in all the
Egyptian temples, and we are told that “many of the
subjects, in the tombs of the kings at Thebes, in
particular, show the importance it was thought to
enjoy in a future state.”<a id="FNanchor_58_58" href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> Crowns, formed of the
asp, or sacred <i>Thermuthis</i>, were given to sovereigns
and divinities, particularly to Isis,<a id="FNanchor_59_59" href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> and these, no doubt,
were intended to symbolise eternal life. Isis was a
goddess of life and healing,<a id="FNanchor_60_60" href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> and the serpent evidently
belonged to her in that character, seeing that it was
the symbol also of other deities with the like attributes.
Thus, on papyri it encircles the figure of
Harpocrates,<a id="FNanchor_61_61" href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> who was identified with Æsculapius;
while not only was a great serpent kept alive in the
temple of Serapis, but on later monuments this god is
represented by a great serpent with or without a human
head.<a id="FNanchor_62_62" href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> Mr. Fergusson, in accordance with his peculiar
theory as to the origin of serpent-worship, thinks
that this superstition characterised the old Turanian
(or let us rather say Akkadian) empire of
Chaldea, while tree-worship was more a characteristic
of the later Assyrian Empire.<a id="FNanchor_63_63" href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> This opinion is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
doubt correct, and it means really that the older race
had that form of faith with which the serpent was
always indirectly connected—adoration of the <i>male</i>
principle of generation, the principal phase of which
was probably ancestor-worship; while the latter race
adored the <i>female</i> principle, symbolised by the sacred
tree, the Assyrian “grove.” The “<i>tree</i> of life,” however,
undoubtedly had reference to the <i>male</i> element,
and we may well imagine that originally the <i>fruit</i> alone
was treated as symbolical of the opposite element.</p>

<p>There is still one important point connected with
this legend which requires consideration as throwing
light on another very widespread superstition. Baron
Bunsen says that the nature of the <i>Kerubim</i> who were
set to keep the way to the tree of life has not yet been
satisfactorily explained. He seems to think they have
a volcanic reference, although the usual supposition is
that they were angels bearing “flaming swords.” The
latter opinion, however, could only have arisen from
the association, in other places, of kerubim with seraphim,
who are also popularly supposed to be angelic
spirits, but whom Bunsen thinks have reference to
flame. All these explanations, however, appear to
me to be erroneous. According to one opinion, kerub
is compounded of two words, <i>ke</i> a particle of resemblance,
and <i>rab</i>, signifying great, powerful. If this
derivation be correct we may safely infer that the
<i>kerub</i> was simply a representation of the strong deity
himself, of whom the flaming sword was also an emblem.
This notion is confirmed by the statement of
the Jewish Targams that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span> “the glory of God dwelt
between the two cherubim at the gate of Eden, just
as it rested upon the two cherubim in the Tabernacle.”<a id="FNanchor_64_64" href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a>
It is curious that in the analogous Greek myth of the
Garden of Hesperides, the golden apples were guarded
by a serpent. We have a closer resemblance to the
Hebrew Kerubim in Persian mythology. Delitzsch
says “the kerubs appear here as guards of Paradise,
just as in the Persian legend 99,999—<i>i.e.</i>, innumerable
attendants of the Holy One keep watch against the
attempts of Ahriman over the tree Hôm, which contains
in itself the power of the resurrection. Much
closer, however, lies the comparison of the winged
lion-and-eagle-formed griffin,<a id="FNanchor_65_65" href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> which watch the gold-caves
of the Arimaspian metallic mountains, and of
the sometimes more or less hawk-formed, sometimes
only winged and otherwise man-formed-guardians,
upon the Egyptian and Assyrian monuments. The resemblance
of the symbols is surprisingly great; and
the comparison of the King of Tyre,<a id="FNanchor_66_66" href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> to a protecting
kerub with outspread wings, who, stationed on the
holy mountain, walked up and down in the midst of the
stones of fire, justifies us in assuming such a connection.”<a id="FNanchor_67_67" href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></p>

<p>The real nature and origin of the Hebrew kerub is
apparent on reference to the language used by Ezekiel
in describing his vision of winged creatures. Dr.
Faber shows clearly that these were the same as the
kerubim in the Holy of Holies of the Hebrew temple,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
and he argues, moreover, with great justice, that the
latter must have agreed with those who were said to
have been stationed before the tree of life in Eden.
In fact, the King of Tyre is styled by Ezekiel “the
anointed covering kerub of Eden, the garden of God.”<a id="FNanchor_68_68" href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>
Now, a curious difference is made by Ezekiel in the
two descriptions he gives of the creatures which appeared
in his vision. In the one case he describes
them as having each four faces—that of a man, that of
a lion, that of an ox, and that of an eagle.<a id="FNanchor_69_69" href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> Subsequently,
however, they are described as having each
the faces of a <i>kerub</i>, of a man, of an eagle, and of a
lion.<a id="FNanchor_70_70" href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> Judging from this discrepancy, the head of a
kerub being substituted for that of an ox, it has been
suggested that the kerub and the ox are synonymous.
Dr. Faber very justly observes on this difficulty, that
Ezekiel “would scarcely have called the head of the
ox by way of eminence the <i>head of a kerub</i>, unless the
form of the ox so greatly predominated in the compound
form of the kerub as to warrant the entire
kerub being familiarly styled <i>an ox</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_71_71" href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> This conclusion
is the more probable when we consider that in
the first vision the creatures are represented with feet
like those of a calf.<a id="FNanchor_72_72" href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> In fact, we have in this vision,
as in the <i>kerubim</i> of Genesis, animal representations of
deity, such as the Persians and other Eastern peoples
delighted in, the most prominent being that of the
ox—or, rather <i>bull</i>, as it would be more properly
rendered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span></p>

<p>But what was the sacred bull of the religions of
antiquity, or rather what its mythological value? Dr.
Faber says expressly on this subject: “There is perhaps
no part of the Gentile world in which the bull and the
cow were not highly reverenced and considered in the
light of holy and mysterious symbols.”<a id="FNanchor_73_73" href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> He cites the
traditional founder of the Chinese empire, Fohi, as having
a son with a bull’s head, this personage being also
venerated by the Japanese under the title of the “ox-headed
prince of heaven.” According to Mr. Doolittle,
a paper image of a domestic buffalo, as large as
life, with smaller images in clay of this animal, are
carried in procession at the Great Chinese Festival in
honour of spring, while a live buffalo accompanies the
procession for some distance.<a id="FNanchor_74_74" href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> It is curious to find
that at the other side of the Europo-Asiatic continent
the bull was considered sacred by the Celtic Druids,
it being reverenced by the ancient Britons as the
symbol of their Great God Hu. Thus also the
Kimbri “adored their principal God under the form
of a brazen bull;” as the ancient Colchians worshipped
brazen-footed bulls which were said to emit fire from
their nostrils, which has reference to the sacrifices
with which they were propitiated. Dr. Faber says as
to the Great Phœnician God, called by the Greek
translator of Sanchoniatho Agruerus, from the circumstance
of his being an agricultural God, that he “was
worshipped by the Syrians and their neighbours the
Canaanites, under the titles of <i>Baal</i> and <i>Moloch</i>; and,
as his shrine was drawn by oxen, so he himself was
represented by the figure of a man having the head of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
a bull, and sometimes probably by the simple figure of
a bull alone”. The Persian <i>Mithra</i> is also represented
as a bull-god, and it is highly suggestive that in one
of the carved grottos near the Campus Marjorum he
is figured under the symbol of the phallus surmounted
by the head of a bull. Even among the Hebrews
themselves the golden calf was, under the authority of
Aaron, used as an object of worship, a form of idolatry
which was re-established by Jeroboam, if it had ever
been abandoned. Dr. Faber, indeed, thinks that the
calves worshipped at Samaria were copies of the
kerubim in the Temple at Jerusalem. If we turn to
peoples kindred to the Hebrews, we find that the
Phœnician Adonis was sometimes represented as a
horned deity, as were also Dionysos and Bacchus,
who were, in fact, merely the names under which
Adonis was worshipped in Thrace and Greece. Plutarch
says that “the women of Elis were accustomed
to invite Bacchus to his temple on the seashore, under
the name of ‘the heifer-footed divinity,’ the illustrious
bull, the bull worthy of the highest veneration.”
Hence in the ceremonies, during the celebration of the
mysteries of Bacchus and Dionysos, the bull always
took a prominent place, as it did also during the
festivals of the allied deity of Egypt—the bull Apis
being worshipped as an incarnation of Osiris. In
India the bull is still held sacred by the Brahmans,
and in Hindu mythology it is connected with both
Siva and Menu.<a id="FNanchor_75_75" href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> A superstitious veneration for this
animal is in fact entertained by all pastoral or agricultural
peoples who possess it. To seek the explanation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
of this curious phenomenon in the traditional remembrance
of the kerubic representations of deity which
guarded the tree of life would be in the highest degree
irrational. These representations were merely copies
of symbolical figures, which, like the story of the fall,
were borrowed from an Eastern source. The real
explanation is found in the fact that the bull was an
emblem of the productive force in nature. The Zend
word <i>gaya</i>, which means “bull,” signifies also the
“soul” or “life,” as the same Arabic word denotes
both “life” and a “serpent.” A parallel case is that
of the Zend word <i>orouéré</i>, which means a “tree” as
well as “life” or “soul.”<a id="FNanchor_76_76" href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> According to the cosmogany
of the Zend-Avesta, Ormuzd, after he had created
the heavens and the earth, formed the first being,
called by Zoroaster “the primeval bull.” This bull
was poisoned by Ahriman, but its seed was carried by
the soul of the dying animal, represented as an <i>ized</i>,
to the moon, “where it is continually purified and
fecundated by the warmth and light of the sun, to
become the germ of all creatures.” At the same time the
material prototypes of all living things, except perhaps
man himself, issued from the body of the bull.<a id="FNanchor_77_77" href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> This
is but a developed form of the ideas which anciently
were almost universally associated with this animal,
among those peoples who were addicted to sun-worship.
There is no doubt, however, that the superstitious
veneration for the bull existed, as it still exists,
quite independent of the worship of the heavenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
bodies.<a id="FNanchor_78_78" href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> The bull, like the goat, must have been a
sacred animal in Egypt before it was declared to be
an embodiment of the sun-god Osiris. In some
sense, indeed, the bull and the serpent, although both
of them became associated with the solar deities, were
antagonistic. The serpent was symbolical of the <i>personal</i>
male element, or rather had especial reference to the
man,<a id="FNanchor_79_79" href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> while the bull had relation to <i>nature</i> as a whole,
and was symbolical of the <i>general</i> idea of fecundity.
This antagonism was brought to an issue in the struggle
between Osiris and Seti (Seth), which ended in
the triumph of the god of nature, although it was
renewed even during the Exodus, when the golden
calf of Osiris or Horus was set up in the Hebrew camp.</p>

<p>The reference made to the serpent, to the tree of
wisdom, and to the bull, in the legend of the “fall,”
sufficiently proves its Phallic character, which was,
indeed, recognised in the early Christian church.<a id="FNanchor_80_80" href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>
Judging from the facts above referred to, however,
we can hardly doubt that the legend was derived from
a foreign source. That it could not be original to the
Hebrews may, I think, be proved by several considerations.
The position occupied in the legend by the
serpent is quite inconsistent with the use of this
animal symbol by Moses.<a id="FNanchor_81_81" href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> Like Satan himself even,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
as the Rev. Dunbar Heath has shown,<a id="FNanchor_82_82" href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> the serpent
had not, indeed, a wholly evil character among the
early Hebrews. In the second place, the condemnation
of the act of generation was directly contrary to
the central idea of patriarchal history. The promise to
Abraham was that he should have seed “numerous as
the stars of heaven for multitude,” and to support this
notion the descent of Abraham is traced up to the first
created man, who is commanded to increase and
multiply.</p>

<p>The legend of the fall is not unknown to Hindu
mythology, but here the subject of the temptation is
the divine Brahma, who, however, is not only mankind
collectively, but a man individually.<a id="FNanchor_83_83" href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> In human shape
he is Sivayambhuva, and to try this progenitor of
mankind, Siva, as the Supreme Being, “drops from
heaven a blossom of the sacred <i>vata</i>, or Indian fig—a
tree which has been always venerated by the natives
on account of its gigantic size and grateful shadows,
and invested alike by Brahman and by Buddhist with
mysterious significations, as the tree of knowledge or
intelligence (<i>bodhidruma</i>).<a id="FNanchor_84_84" href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> Captivated by the beauty
of the blossom, the first man (Brahma) is determined
to possess it. He imagines that it will entitle him to
occupy the place of the Immortal, and hold converse
with the Infinite; and on gathering up the blossom,<a id="FNanchor_85_85" href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
he at once becomes intoxicated by this fancy, and
believes himself immortal and divine. But ere the
flush of exultation has subsided, God Himself appears
to him in terrible majesty; and the astonished culprit,
stricken by the curse of heaven, is banished far from
Brahmapattana, and consigned to an abyss of misery
and degradation. From this, however, adds the story,
an escape is rendered possible on the expiration of
some weary term of suffering and of penance. And
the parallelism which it presents to sacred history is
well-nigh completed when the legend tells us further
that woman, his own wife, whose being was derived
from his, had instigated the ambitious hopes which
led to their expulsion, and entailed so many ills on
their posterity.”<a id="FNanchor_86_86" href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> That parallelism cannot well be the
result of mere coincidence, and the reference to the
fig-tree in the Hindu legend not only renders it highly
probable that this was the tree of knowledge<a id="FNanchor_87_87" href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> of
Hebrew legend, but confirms, by the symbolical ideas
connected with it, the explanation of the nature of
the “fall” given in the preceding pages. The real
meaning of the legend was well understood by the
Gnostics and Manicheans, and those Christian Fathers
who were brought into contact with Eastern ideas
through them.<a id="FNanchor_88_88" href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></p>

<p>The Persians, who were indebted to the Chaldeans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
for many of their religious ideas, possessed the story
of the fall in a form agreeing more closely with that
which may have been the original of the Hebrew
legend. According to the <i>Boundehesch</i>, one of the
sacred books of the Parsees, a tree gave birth to the
primeval man <i>Meschia</i>. The body of this androgynous
being afterwards became divided, one part being male
and the other female—<i>Meschia</i> and <i>Meschiana</i>,<a id="FNanchor_89_89" href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> as the
man and woman were called—were at first pure and
holy, but seduced by Ahriman, who had metamorphosed
himself into a serpent, they rendered to the
Prince of Darkness the worship which was due only
to Ormuzd, the God of Light. Meschia and Meschiana
thus lost their primitive purity, which neither they
nor their descendants could recover without the
assistance of Mithra, the god who presided at the
mysteries or at the initiations—that is to say, at the
way of rehabilitation which is opened before those
who seek earnestly the salvation of their souls.<a id="FNanchor_90_90" href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> At
the instigation of Ahriman, the man and woman had,
for the first time, committed, in thought, word, and
deed, the carnal sin, and thus tainted with original
sin all their descendants.<a id="FNanchor_91_91" href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> Lajard, referring to this
legend, adds in a note:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span> “Le triple caractère que presente
ici le péché originel est très nettement indiqué
dans le passage cité du Boundehesch. Il y est
accompagné de détails que font de ce passage un des
morceaux les plus curieux de ce traité. Quelques-uns
de ces détails ... rattache à ce même mot (serpent)
ou à sa racine la dénomination des parties sexuelles
de la homme et de la femme.” The Persian account
of the fall and its consequences agrees so closely with
the Hebrew story when stripped of its figurative
language that we cannot doubt that they refer to the
same legend,<a id="FNanchor_92_92" href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> and the use of figurative language in the
latter may well lead us to believe that it was of later
date than the former.<a id="FNanchor_93_93" href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> In Ahriman, who was known to
Persian teaching as “the old serpent having two feet,”
we evidently have the origin of the speaking serpent
of Genesis, while in “the seed of the woman who
shall bruise the serpent’s head,” the follower of
Zarathustra would have seen a reference to Mithra,
just as the Christian finds there a prophecy of Christ.
Even the antagonism between the Cherubim and the
Serpent can be found in Persian teaching, for it was
to the malignant action of the Serpent Az that the
death, not only of the first man, but of the “primeval
bull,” was due.<a id="FNanchor_94_94" href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> The latter was formed by
Ormuzd after the creation of the heavens and the
earth, and that from which proceeded the material
prototypes of all the beings “who live in the water,
on the earth, and in the air.”<a id="FNanchor_95_95" href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<p>It is very probable, however, that when the legend
was appropriated by the compiler of the Hebrew
Scriptures it had a moral significance as well as a
merely figurative sense. The legend is divisible into
two parts—the first of which is a mere statement of
the imparting of wisdom by the serpent and by the
eating of the fruit of a certain tree, these ideas being
synonymous, or at least consistent, as appears by the
attributes of the Chaldean <i>Héa</i>.<a id="FNanchor_96_96" href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> The nature of this
wisdom may be found in the rites of the Hindu
<i>Sacti Puja</i>.<a id="FNanchor_97_97" href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> The second part of the legend, which
is probably of much later date, is the condemnation of
the act referred to, as being in itself evil and as leading
to misery, and even to death itself. The origin of
this later notion must be sought in the esoteric doctrine
taught in the mysteries of Mithra, the fundamental
idea of which was the descent of the soul to
earth and its re-ascent to the celestial abodes after it
had overcome the temptations and debasing influences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
of the material life.<a id="FNanchor_98_98" href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> Lajard shows that these mysteries
were really taken from the secret worship of the
Chaldean <i>Mylitta</i>, but the reference to “the seed of
the woman who shall bruise the serpent’s head,” is
too Mithraic for us to seek for an earlier origin for
the special form of the Hebrew myth. The object
of the myth evidently was to explain the origin of
<i>death</i>,<a id="FNanchor_99_99" href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> from which man was to be delivered by a
coming Saviour, and the whole idea is strictly
Mithraic, the Persian deity himself being a Saviour
God.<a id="FNanchor_100_100" href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> The importance attached to <i>virginity</i> by the
early Christians sprang from the same source. The
Avesta is full of reference to “purity” of life, and
there is reason to believe that in the secret initiations
the followers of Mithra were taught to regard marriage
itself as impure.<a id="FNanchor_101_101" href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></p>

<p>The religious ideas which found expression in the
legend of the fall were undoubtedly of late development,<a id="FNanchor_102_102" href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a>
although derived from still earlier phases of religious
thought. The simple worship in symbol of the
organs of generation, and of the ancestral head of the
family, prompted by the desire for offspring and the
veneration for him who produced it, was extended to
the generative force in nature. The bull which, as we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
have seen, symbolised this force, was not restricted to
earth, but was in course of time transferred to the
heavens, and as one of the constellations was thought
to have a peculiar relation to certain of the planetary
bodies. This astral phase of the Phallic superstition
was not unknown to the Mosaic religion. A still
earlier form of this superstition was, however, known
to the Hebrews, probably forming a link between
the worship of the symbol of personal generative
power and that of the heavenly phallus; as the
worship of the bull connected the veneration for
the human generator with that for the universal father.
One of the primeval gods of antiquity was <i>Hermes</i>,
the Syro-Egyptian <i>Thoth</i>, and the Roman <i>Mercury</i>.
Kircher identifies him also with the god <i>Terminus</i>.
This is doubtless true, as Hermes was a god of boundaries,
and appears, as Dulaure has well shown, to
have presided over the national frontiers. The meaning
of the word “Thoth”—<i>erecting</i>—associates it with
this fact. The peculiar primitive form of Mercury or
Hermes was “a large stone, frequently square, and
without either hands or feet. Sometimes the triangular
shape was preferred, sometimes an upright
pillar, and sometimes a heap of rude stones!”<a id="FNanchor_103_103" href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> The
pillars were called by the Greeks <i>Hermæ</i>, and the
heaps were known as <i>Hermèan</i> heaps—the latter being
accumulated “by the custom of each passenger throwing
a stone to the daily-increasing mass in honour of
the god.” Sometimes the pillar was represented with
the attributes of Priapus.<a id="FNanchor_104_104" href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

<p>The identification of Hermes or Mercury with
Priapus is confirmed by the offices which the latter
deity fulfilled. One of the most important was that
of protector of gardens and orchards, and probably
this was the original office performed by Hermes in
his character of “a God of the country.”<a id="FNanchor_105_105" href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> Figures set
up as charms to protect the produce of the ground
would, in course of time, be used not only for this
purpose, but also to mark the boundaries of the land
protected, and these two offices being divided, two
deities would finally be formed out of one. The
Greek Hermes was connected also with the Egyptian
<i>Khem</i>, and no less, if we may judge from the symbols
used in his worship, with the Hebrew <i>Eloah</i>.
Thus, in the history of the Hebrew patriarchs, we are
told that when Jacob entered into a covenant with
his father-in-law, Laban, a pillar was set up and a
heap of stones made, and Laban said to Jacob,
“Behold this heap and behold this pillar, which I
have cast betwixt me and thee; this heap be witness,
and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over
this heap to thee, and that thou shall not pass over this
heap and this pillar unto me for harm.”<a id="FNanchor_106_106" href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> We have here
the <i>Hermæ</i> and <i>Hermèan</i> heap, used by the Greeks as
landmarks and placed by them on the public roads.
In the <i>linga</i> of India we have another instance of
the use of the pillar symbol. The form of this symbol
is sufficiently expressive of the idea which it
embodies, an idea which is more explicitly shown
when the Linga and the Yoni are, as is usually the case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
among the worshippers of the Hindu Siva, combined
to form the <i>Lingam</i>. The stone figure is not, however,
itself a god, but only representative of a spirit,<a id="FNanchor_107_107" href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a>
who is thought to be able to satisfy the yearning
for children, so characteristic of many primitive
peoples, this probably having been its original object
and the source of its use as an amulet for the protection
of children against the influence of the evil eye.
In course of time, however, when other property
came to be coveted equally with offspring, the power
to give this property would naturally be referred to
the primitive Phallic spirit, and hence he became,
not merely the protector, as above seen, of the produce
of the fields, and the guardian of boundaries,
but also the God of wealth and traffic, and even the
patron of thieves, as was the case with the Mercury
of the Romans. The Hebrew patriarchs desired
great flocks as well as numerous descendants, and
hence the symbolic pillar was peculiarly fitted for
their religious rites. It is related even of Abraham,
the traditional founder of the Hebrew people, that he
“planted a grove<a id="FNanchor_108_108" href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> (<i>eshel</i>) in Beersheba, and called
there on the name of Jehovah, the everlasting <i>Elohim</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_109_109" href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a>
From the Phallic character of the “grove” (<i>ashera</i>),<a id="FNanchor_110_110" href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a>
said to have been in the House of Jehovah, we
must suppose that the <i>eshel</i> of Abraham also had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
a Phallic reference.<a id="FNanchor_111_111" href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> Most probably the so-called
“grove” of the earlier patriarch, though perhaps of
wood, and the stone “<i>bethel</i>” of Jacob had the same
form, and were simply the <i>betylus</i>,<a id="FNanchor_112_112" href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> the primitive
symbol of deity among all the Semitic and many
Hamitic peoples.</p>

<p>The participation of the Hebrew patriarchs in the
rites connected with the “pillar-worship” of the ancient
world, renders it extremely probable that they were
not strangers to the later planetary worship. Many
of the old Phallic symbols were associated with the
new superstition, and Abraham, being a Chaldean, it is
natural to suppose that he was one of its adherents.
Tradition, indeed, affirms that Abraham was a great
astronomer, and at one time at least a worshipper of
the heavenly bodies, and that he and the other
patriarchs continued to be affected by this superstition
is shown by various incidents related in the
Pentateuch. Thus, in the description given of the
sacrificial covenant between Abraham and Jehovah, it
is said that, after Abraham had divided the sacrificial
animals, a deep sleep fell upon him as the sun was
going down, and Jehovah spoke with him. “Then
when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a
smoking furnace, and a burning lamp, that passed
between those pieces.” The happening of this event
at the moment of the sun’s setting reminds us of the
Sabæan custom of praying to the setting sun, still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
practised, according to Palgrave, among the nomads
of central Arabia. That some great <i>religious</i> movement,
ascribed by tradition to Abraham, did take
place among the Semites at an early date is undoubted.
What the object of this covenant was it is difficult to
decide. It should be remembered that the Chaldeans
worshipped a plurality of gods, supposed to
have been symbolised by the seven planets. Among
these deities the sun-god held a comparatively inferior
position—the moon-god <i>Hurki</i> coming before him in
the second triad.<a id="FNanchor_113_113" href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> It was at Ur, the special seat of
the worship of the moon-god,<a id="FNanchor_114_114" href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> that Abraham is said
to have lived before he quitted it for Haran. This
fact, considered in the light of the traditions relating
to the great patriarch, may perhaps justify us in inferring
that the reformation he endeavoured to introduce
was the substitution of a simple sun-worship, for the
planetary cultus of the Chaldeans, in which the
worship of the moon must to him have appeared to
occupy an important place. The new faith was,
indeed, a return to the old Phallic idea of a god of personal
generation, worshipped through the symbolical
<i>betylus</i>, but associated also with the adoration of the
sun as the especial representative of the deity. That
Abraham had higher notions of the relation of man
to the divine being than his forerunners is very pro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>bable,
but his sojourn in Haran proves that there was
nothing fundamentally different between his religious
faith and that of his Syrian neighbours. I am inclined,
indeed, to believe that to the traditional Abraham
must be ascribed the establishment of sun-worship
throughout Phœnicia and Lower Egypt in connection
with the symbols of an earlier and more simple Phallic
deity. Tradition, in fact, declares that he taught the
Egyptians astronomy,<a id="FNanchor_115_115" href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> and we shall see that the religion
of the Phœnicians, as, indeed, that of the
Hebrews themselves, was the worship of Saturn, the
erect, pillar-god who, under different names, appears
to have been at the head of the pantheons of most of
the peoples of antiquity. The reference in Hebrew
history to the <i>seraphim</i> of Jacob’s family recalls the
fact that Abraham’s father was <i>Terah</i>, a “maker of
images.” The <i>teraphim</i> were doubtless the same as the
<i>seraphim</i>, which were serpent images,<a id="FNanchor_116_116" href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> and probably
the household charms or idols of the Semitic
worshippers of the sun-god, to whom the serpent
was sacred.</p>

<p>Little is known of the religious habits of the
Hebrews during their abode in Egypt. Probably
they differed little from those of the Egyptians themselves,
and even in the religion of Moses, so-called,
which we may presume to have been a reformed
faith, there are many points of contact with the earlier
cultus. The use of the ark of Osiris and Isis shows
the influence of Egyptian ideas, and the introduction
of the new name for God, <i>Jahve</i>, is evidence of contact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
with later Phœnician thought. The ark was doubtless
used to symbolise nature, as distinguished from
the serpent and pillar symbols, which had relation
more particularly to man. The latter, however, were
by far the most important, as they were most intimately
connected with the worship of the national
deity, who was the divine father, as Abraham was the
human progenitor, of the Hebrew people. That this
deity, notwithstanding his change of name, retained
his character of a sun-god, is shown by the fact that
he is repeatedly said to have appeared to Moses under
the figure of a flame. The pillar of fire which guided
the Hebrews by night in the wilderness, the appearance
of the cloudy pillar at the door of the Tabernacle,
and probably of a flame over the mercy seat to betoken
the presence of Jehovah, and the perpetual fire on the
altar, all point to the same conclusion. The notion
entertained by Ewald that the idea connected with
the Hebrew Jahve was that of a “Deliverer” or a
“Healer” (Saviour)<a id="FNanchor_117_117" href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> is quite consistent with the fact
I have stated. The primeval Phenic deity El or
Cronus was not only the preserver of the world, for
the benefit of which he offered a mystical sacrifice,<a id="FNanchor_118_118" href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a>
but “Saviour” was a common title of the sun-gods of
antiquity.</p>

<p>There is one remarkable incident which is said to
have happened during the wanderings of the Hebrews
in the Sinaitic wilderness which appears to throw
much light on the character of the Mosaic cultus and
to connect it with other religions. I refer to the use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
of the brazen serpent as a symbol for the healing of
the people. The worship of the golden calf may,
perhaps, be said to be an idolatrous act in imitation
of the rites of Egyptian Osiris worship, although
probably suggested by the use of the ark. The other
case, however, is far different, and it is worth while
repeating the exact words in which the use of the
serpent symbol is described. When the people were
bitten by the “fiery” serpents,<a id="FNanchor_119_119" href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> Moses prayed for them,
and we read that, therefore, “Jehovah said unto
Moses, make thee a fiery serpent (literally, a <i>seraph</i>),
and set it upon a pole; and it shall come to pass,
that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it,
shall live. And Moses made a serpent of brass, and
put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent
had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of
brass, he lived.”<a id="FNanchor_120_120" href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> It would seem from this account
that the Hebrew seraph was, as before suggested, in
the form of a serpent; but what was the especial
significance of this healing figure? At an earlier
stage of our inquiry reference was made to the fact of
the serpent being indirectly, through its attribute of
wisdom, a Phallic symbol, but also directly an emblem
of “life,” and to the peculiar position it held in nearly
all the religions of antiquity. In later Egyptian
mythology the contest between Osiris and the Evil
Being, and afterwards that between Horus and Typhon,
occupy an important place. Typhon, the adversary of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
Horus, was figured under the symbol of a serpent,
called Aphôphis or the Giant,<a id="FNanchor_121_121" href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> and it cannot be doubted
that, if not a form of, he was identified with the god
Seth. Professor Reuvens refers to an invocation of
Typhon-Seth,<a id="FNanchor_122_122" href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> and Bunsen quotes the statement of
Epiphanius that “the Egyptians celebrate the festivals
of Typhon under the form of an ass, which they call
Seth.”<a id="FNanchor_123_123" href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> Whatever may be the explanation of the
fact, it is undoubted that, notwithstanding the hatred
with which he was afterwards regarded, this god Seth
or Set was at one time highly venerated in Egypt.
Bunsen says that up to the thirteenth century B.C.
Set “was a great god universally adored throughout
Egypt, who confers on the sovereigns of the eighteenth
and nineteenth dynasties the symbols of life and
power. The most glorious monarch of the latter
dynasty, Sethos, derives his name from this deity.”
He adds: “But subsequently, in the course of the
twentieth dynasty, he is suddenly treated as an evil
demon, inasmuch as his effigies and name are obliterated
on all the monuments and inscriptions that could
be reached.” Moreover, according to this distinguished
writer, Seth “appears gradually among the
Semites as the background of their religious consciousness;”
and not merely was he “the primitive god of
Northern Egypt and Palestine,” but his genealogy as
“the Seth of Genesis, the father of Enoch (the man),
must be considered as originally running parallel with
that derived from the Elohim, Adam’s father.”<a id="FNanchor_124_124" href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
Seth <i>had</i> some special connection with the Hebrews
is proved, among other things, by the peculiar position
occupied in their religious system by the <i>ass</i>—the
first-born of which alone of all animals was allowed
to be redeemed<a id="FNanchor_125_125" href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a>—and the <i>red heifer</i>, whose ashes were
to be reserved as a “water of separation” for purification
from sin.<a id="FNanchor_126_126" href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> Both of these animals were in Egypt
sacred to Seth (Typhon), the ass being his symbol,
and red oxen being at one time sacrificed to him,
although at a later date objects of a red colour were
disliked, owing to their association with the dreaded
Typhon.<a id="FNanchor_127_127" href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> That we have a reference to this deity in
the name of the Hebrew lawgiver is very probable.
No satisfactory derivation of this name, Moses, Môsheh
(Heb.), has yet been given. Its original form was probably
<i>Am-a-ses</i> or <i>Am-sesa</i>,<a id="FNanchor_128_128" href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> which might become
to the Hebrews Om-ses or Mo-ses, meaning only <i>the</i>
(god) Ses, <i>i.e.</i>, Set or Seth.<a id="FNanchor_129_129" href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> On this hypothesis we
may have preserved, in the first book of Moses (so-called),
some of the traditional history said to have
been contained in the sacred books of the Egyptian
Thoth, and of the records engraved on the pillars of
Seth. It is somewhat remarkable that, according to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
a statement of Diodorus, when Antiochus Epiphanes
entered the temple at Jerusalem, he found in the
Holy of Holies a stone figure of Moses, represented as
a man with a long beard, mounted on an ass, and
having a book in his hand.<a id="FNanchor_130_130" href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> The Egyptian Mythus
of Typhon actually said that Set fled from Egypt
riding on a grey ass.<a id="FNanchor_131_131" href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> It is strange, to say the least,
that Moses should not have been allowed to enter the
promised land, and that he should be so seldom
referred to by later writers until long after the reign
of David,<a id="FNanchor_132_132" href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> and above all that the name given to his
successor was Joshua—<i>i.e.</i>, <i>Saviour</i>. It is worthy of
notice that “Nun,” the name of the father of Joshua,
is the Semitic word for <i>fish</i>, the Phallic character of
the fish in Chaldean mythology being undoubted.
<i>Nin</i>, the planet Saturn, was the fish-god of Berosus,
and, as may possibly be shown, he is really the same as
the Assyrian national deity <i>Asshur</i>, whose name and
office have a curious resemblance to those of the
Hebrew leader, <i>Joshua</i>.</p>

<p>But what was the character of the primitive
Semitic deity? Bunsen seems to think that Plutarch
in one passage alludes to the identity of Typhon
(Seth) and Osiris.<a id="FNanchor_133_133" href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> This is a remarkable idea, and
yet curiously enough Sir Gardner Wilkinson says that
Typhon-Seth may have been derived from the pigmy
Pthath-Sokari-Osiris,<a id="FNanchor_134_134" href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> who was clearly only another
form of Osiris himself. In the Egyptian Book of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
Dead, Horus, the son of Osiris, is declared to be at
the same time Set, “by the distinction made between
them by Thoth.”<a id="FNanchor_135_135" href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> However that may be, the
Phallic origin of Seth can be shown from other data.
Thus it appears that the word <i>Set</i> means, in Hebrew
as in Egyptian, pillar, and, in a general sense, the
erect, elevated, high.<a id="FNanchor_136_136" href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> Moreover, in a passage of the
Book of the Dead, Set, according to Bunsen, is
called <i>Tet</i>, a fact which intimates that Thoth
inherited many of the attributes of Set.<a id="FNanchor_137_137" href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> They were,
however, in some sense the same deities, it being
through Thoth that Set was identified with Horus.
We have here an explanation of the statement
that Tet, the Phœnician <i>Taaut</i>, was the snake-god,
Esmun-Esculapius, the serpent being the symbol
of Tet, as we have seen it to have been that of Seth
also. In this we have a means of identifying the
Semitic deity Seth with the Saturn of related deities
of other peoples. Ewald says that “the common
name for God, <i>Eloah</i>, among the Hebrews, as among
all the Semites, goes back into the earliest times.”<a id="FNanchor_138_138" href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a>
Bryant goes further, and declares that El was originally
the name of the supreme deity among all the
nations of the East.<a id="FNanchor_139_139" href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> This idea is confirmed, so far as
Chaldea is concerned, by later researches, which show
that Il or El was at the head of the Babylonian
Pantheon. With this deity must be identified the
Il or Ilus of the Phœnicians, who was born the same as
Cronus, who, again, was none other than the primeval<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
Saturn, whose worship appears to have been at one
period almost universal among European and Asiatic
peoples. Saturn and El were thus the same deity,
the latter, like the Semitic Seth, being, as is well
known, symbolised by the serpent.<a id="FNanchor_140_140" href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> A direct point
of contact between Seth and Saturn is found in the
Hebrew idol <i>Kiyun</i> mentioned by Amos, the planet
Saturn being still called <i>Kevan</i> by Eastern peoples.
This idol was represented in the form of a pillar, the
primeval symbol of deity, which was common undoubtedly
to all the gods here mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_141_141" href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> These
symbolical pillars were called <i>betyli</i> or <i>betulia</i>. Sometimes
also the column was called <i>Abaddir</i>, which,
strangely enough, Bryant identifies with the serpent-god.<a id="FNanchor_142_142" href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a>
There can be no doubt that both the pillar
and the serpent were associated with many of the sun-gods
of antiquity.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding what has been said it is undoubtedly
true, however, that all these deities, including
the Semitic Seth, became at an early date
recognised as sun-gods, although in so doing they lost
nothing of their primitive character. What this was
is sufficiently shown by the significant names and
titles they bore. Thus, as we have seen, <i>Set</i>
(Seth) itself meant the <i>erect</i>, <i>elevated</i>, <i>high</i>, his name
on the Egyptian monuments being nearly always
accompanied by a stone.<a id="FNanchor_143_143" href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> The name, <i>Kiyun</i> or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
<i>Kevan</i>, of this deity, said by Amos to have been
worshipped in the wilderness, signifies “god of the
pillar.” The idea expressed by the title is shown
by the name <i>Baal Tamar</i>, which means “Baal as a
pillar,” or “Phallus,” consequently “the fructifying
god.” The title “erect,” when given to a deity, seems
always to imply a Phallic idea, and hence we have
the explanation of the <i>S. mou</i> used frequently in
the “Book of the Dead” in relation to Thoth or to
Set.<a id="FNanchor_144_144" href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> There is doubtless a reference of the same kind
in the Phœnician myth, that “Melekh taught men the
special art of creating solid walls and buildings;”
although Bunsen finds in this myth “the symbolical
mode of expressing the value of the use of fire in
building houses.”<a id="FNanchor_145_145" href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> That these myths embody a Phallic
notion may be confirmed by reference to the Phœnician
<i>Kabiri</i>. According to Bunsen, “the Kabiri and the
divinities identified with them are explained by the
Greeks and Romans as ‘the strong,’ ‘the great;’”
while in the book of Job, <i>Kabbîr</i>, the strong, is used
as an epithet of God. Again, <i>Sydyk</i>, the father of the
Kabiri, is “the Just,” or, in a more original sense,
the Upright; and this deity, with his sons, correspond
to Ptah, the father of the Phœnician Pataikoi. Ptah,
however, seems to be derived from a root which
signifies in Hebrew “to open,” and Sydyk himself,
therefore, may, says Bunsen, be described as “the
Opener” of the Cosmic Egg.<a id="FNanchor_146_146" href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> The Phallic meaning
of this title is evident from its application to Esmun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>-Esculapius,
the son of Sydyk, who, as the snake-god,
was identical with Tet, the Egyptian Thoth-Hermes.</p>

<p>The peculiar titles given to these deities, and their
association with the sun, led to their original Phallic
character being somewhat overlooked, and instead of
being the Father-Gods of human-kind, they became
<i>Powerful</i> Gods, <i>Lords</i> of Heaven. This was not the
special attribute taken by other sun-gods. As was
before stated, Hermes and his related deities were
“gods of the country,” personifying the idea of
general natural fecundity. Among the chief gods of
this description were the Phœnician <i>Sabazius</i>, the
Greek <i>Bacchus-Dionysos</i>, the Roman <i>Priapus</i>, and the
Egyptian <i>Khem</i>. All these deities agree also in being
sun-gods, and as such they were symbolised by
animals which were noted either for their fecundity or
for their salaciousness. The chief animals thus chosen
were the <i>bull</i> and the <i>goat</i> (with which the ram<a id="FNanchor_147_147" href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> was
afterwards confounded), doubtless because they were
already sacred. The Sun appears to have been preceded
by the Moon as an object of worship, but the
moon-god was probably only representative of the
primeval Saturn,<a id="FNanchor_148_148" href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> who finally became the sun-god <i>El</i>
or <i>Il</i> of the Syrian and Semites and the <i>Ra</i> of the
Babylonians. The latter was the title also of the
sun-god of Egypt, who was symbolised by the obelisk,
and who, although his name was added to that of
other Egyptian gods, is said to have been the tutelary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
deity of the stranger kings of the eighteenth dynasty,<a id="FNanchor_149_149" href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a>
whom Pleyte, however, declares to have been Set
(Sutech).<a id="FNanchor_150_150" href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> We are reminded here of the opposition
of Seth and Osiris, which has already been explained
as arising from the fact that these deities originally
represented two different ideas, <i>human fecundity</i> and
the <i>fruitfulness of nature</i>. When, however, both of
these principles became associated with the solar body,
they were expressed by the same symbols, and the
distinction between them was in great measure lost
sight of. A certain difference was, nevertheless, still
observable in the attributes of the deities, depending
on the peculiar properties and associations of their
solar representatives. Thus the powerful deity of
Phœnicia was naturally associated with the strong,
scorching, summer sun, whose <i>heat</i> was the most prominent
attribute. In countries such as Egypt, where
the sun, acting on the moist soil left by inundations,
caused the earth to spring into renewed life, the mild
but energetic early sun was the chief deity.</p>

<p>When, considering the sacred bull of antiquity, the
symbol of the fecundating force in nature, Osiris, the
national sun-god of the Egyptians, was referred to as
distinguished from the Semitic Seth (Set), who was
identified with the detested shepherd race. The
association of Osiris with Khem shows his Phallic
character,<a id="FNanchor_151_151" href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> and, in fact, Plutarch asserts that he was
everywhere represented with the phallus exposed.<a id="FNanchor_152_152" href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
The Phallic idea enters, moreover, into the character
of all the chief Egyptian deities. Bunsen says: “The
mythological system obviously proceeded from ‘the
concealed god’ Ammon to the creating god. The
latter appears first of all as the generative power of
nature in the Phallic god Khem, who is afterwards
merged in Ammon-ra. Then sprung up the idea of
the creative power in Kneph. He forms the divine
limbs of Osiris (the primeval soul) in contradiction to
Ptah, who as the strictly demiurgic principle, forms the
visible world. Neith is the creative principle, as
nature represented under a feminine form. Finally,
her son Ra, Helios, appears as the last of the series, in
the character of father and nourisher of terrestrial
beings. It is he, whom an ancient monument represents
as the demiurgic principle, creating the mundane
egg.”<a id="FNanchor_153_153" href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> The name of Ammon has led to the notion
that he was an embodiment of the idea of wisdom.
He certainly was distinguished by having the human
form, but his hieroglyphical symbol of the <i>obelisk</i>, and
his connection with Khem, show his true nature. He
undoubtedly represented the primitive idea of a generative
god, probably at a time when this notion of
fecundity had not yet been extended to nature as distinguished
from man, and thus he would form a point
of contact between the later Egyptian sun-gods and
the pillar gods of the Semites and Phœnicians.<a id="FNanchor_154_154" href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
the Egyptians, as to these other peoples, the sun
became the great source of deity. His fecundating
warmth or his fiery destroying heat were, however,
not the only attributes deified. These were the most
important, but the Egyptians, especially, made gods
out of many of the solar characters,<a id="FNanchor_155_155" href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> although the association
of the idea of “intellect” with Amun-re must
have been of late date, if the original nature of Amun
was what has been above suggested.</p>

<p>As man, however, began to read nature aright, and
as his moral and intellectual faculties were developed,
it was necessary that the solar deities themselves
should become invested with co-relative attributes, or
that other gods should be formed to embody them.
The perception of <i>light</i>, as distinguished from heat,
was a fertile source of such attributes. In the Chaldean
mythology, <i>Vul</i>, the son of <i>Anu</i>, was the god of
the air, but his power had relation to the purely
atmospheric phenomena rather than to light.<a id="FNanchor_156_156" href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> The
only reference to light found in the titles of the early
deities is in the character ascribed to <i>Va-lua</i>, the later
<i>Bur</i> or <i>Nin-ip</i>, who is said to “irradiate the nations
like the sun, the light of the gods.”<a id="FNanchor_157_157" href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> But this deity
was apparently the distant planet Saturn, if not originally
the moon, and the perception of light as a divine
attribute must be referred to the Aryan mind.<a id="FNanchor_158_158" href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> Thus
the Hindu <i>Dyaus</i> (the Greek <i>Zeus</i>) is the shining
deity, the god of the bright sky. As such the sun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>-gods
now also become the gods of intellectual wisdom,
an attribute which also appears to have originated
with the Aryan peoples, among whom the Brahmans
were possessors of the highest wisdom, as children of
the sun, and whose Apollo and Athené were noble
embodiments of this attribute. The Chaldean gods,
<i>Héa</i> and <i>Nebo</i>, were undoubtedly symbolised by the
wedge or arrow-head, which had especial reference
to learning. In reality, however, this symbol merely
shows that they were the patrons of letters or writing,
and not of wisdom, in its purely intellectual aspect.
If the form of the Assyrian alphabetical character was
of Phallic origin,<a id="FNanchor_159_159" href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> we may have here the source of the
idea of a connection between physical and mental
knowledge embodied in the legend of the “fall.” In
the Persian <i>Ahurô-mazdâo</i> (the wise spirit) we have
the purest representation of intellectual wisdom. The
book of Zoroaster, the Avesta, is literally the “word,”
the word or wisdom which was revealed in creation
and embodied in the divine Mithra, who was himself
the luminous sun-god.</p>

<p>The similarity between the symbols of the sun-gods
of antiquity and the natural objects introduced into
the Mosaic myth of the fall has been already referred
to, and it is necessary now to consider shortly what influence
the Phallic principle there embodied had over
other portions of Hebraic theology. The inquiries of
Dr. Faber have thrown great light on this question,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
although the explanation given by him of the myth of
Osiris and of the kindred myths of antiquity is by no
means the correct one. Finding a universal prevalence
of Phallic ideas and symbolism, Dr. Faber refers it to
the degradation of a primitive revelation of the Great
Father of the Universe. The truth thus taught was
lost sight of, and was replaced by the dual notion of
a Great Father and a Great Mother—“the transmigrating
Noah and the mundane Ark” of the universal
Deluge. Noah was, however, only a reappearance of
Adam, and the ark floating on the waters of the
Deluge was an analogue of the earth swimming in the
ocean of space.<a id="FNanchor_160_160" href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> There is undoubtedly a parallelism
between the Adam and Noah of the Hebrew legends,
as there is between the analogous personages of other
phases of these legends, yet it is evident that, if the
Deluge never happened, a totally different origin from
the one supposed by Dr. Faber must be assigned to
the great Phallic myth of antiquity. It is absolutely
necessary, therefore, to any explanation (other than
the Phallic one) of the origin of this myth, to establish
the truth of the Noahic Deluge.<a id="FNanchor_161_161" href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> Accordingly,
an American writer has framed an elaborate system
of “Arkite symbolism,” founded on the supposed influence
of the great Deluge over the minds of the
posterity of those who survived its horrors. Mr. Lesley
sees in this catastrophe the explanation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span> “phallism,”
which, “converting all the older Arkite symbols into
illustrations of its own philosophical conceptions of the
mystery of generation, gave to the various parts and
members of the human body those names which constitute
the special vocabulary of obscenity of the present
day.”<a id="FNanchor_162_162" href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">162</a></p>

<p>But the priority of these symbols or conceptions
is the question at issue. Did the development of
“Arkism” precede or follow the superstitions referred
to by Mr. Lesley as <i>Ophism</i>, <i>Mithraism</i>, and <i>Phallism</i>,
all of which have been shown to embody analogous
ideas? If the question of priority is to be determined
by reference to the written tradition which furnishes the
real ground of belief in a great Deluge, it must clearly
be given to the Phallic superstition; for it is shown
conclusively, as I think, that almost the first event in
the life of man there related is purely Phallic in its
symbolism. Nor is the account of the fall the only
portion of the Mosaic history of primitive man which
belongs to this category. The Garden of Eden, with
its tree of life and the river which divided into four
streams, although it may have had a secondary reference
to the traditional place of Semitic origin to which
the Hebrews looked back with a regretful longing, has
undoubtedly a recondite Phallic meaning. It must be
so, if the explanation I have given of the myth of the
fall be right, since the two are intimately connected,
and the Garden<a id="FNanchor_163_163" href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> is essential to the succeeding catas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>trophe.
That this opinion is correct can be proved moreover
by reference to Hindu mythology. “The Hindu,”
says Dr. Creuzer, “contemplates with love his mysterious
Merou, a sacred mountain from whence the
source of life spreads itself in the valleys and over the
plains, which separates day from night, reunites heaven
and earth, and finally on which the sun, the moon,
and the stars each repose.”<a id="FNanchor_164_164" href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> But what is this mysterious
mountain, the sacred Merou? It is shown by
Dr. Creuzer’s own explanation. He says: “It is on
the Mount Merou, the central point of the earth (which
elevates itself as an immense phallus from the centre
of an immense yoni amongst the islands with which
the sea is sown), that the grand popular deity who
presides over the Lingam, <i>Siva</i> or Mahadeva, the
father and master of nature, makes his cherished
abode, spreading life to every part under a thousand
diverse forms which he incessantly renews. Near him
is <i>Bhavani</i> or <i>Parvati</i>, his sister and his wife, the
Queen of the mountains, the goddess of the Yoni, who
carries in her bosom the germ of all things, and brings
forth the beings whom she has conceived by Mahadeva.
We have here the two great principles of
nature, the one male and the other female, generators
and regenerators, creators and at the same time destroyers;
but they destroy only to renew; they
only change the forms; life and death succeed in a
perfect circle, and the substance remains in the midst
of all these changes.” The sacred mountain is wanting
to the Mosaic legend, but Dr. Faber justly sees<a id="FNanchor_165_165" href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
the Mount Merou, where resides Siva and Bhavani,
the Hebrew Paradise, and we find that the Hindu
myth affirms that the sacred river not only sprang
from the roots of Jambu, a tree of a most extravagant
size, which is thought to convey knowledge and to
effect the accomplishment of every human wish, but
also that, after passing through “the circle of the
moon,” it divides it into “four streams, flowing towards
the four cardinal points.”</p>

<p>The priority of the Phallic superstition over “Arkism”
is further proved by the undoubted fact that, even in
the traditions of the race to whom we are indebted
for the precise details of the incidents accompanying
the Deluge, the Phallic deities of the Hamitico-Semites
are genealogically placed long before the occurrence
of this event. The Semitic deity Seth is, according
to one fable, the semi-divine first ancestor of the
Semites. Bunsen has shown clearly also that several
of the antediluvian descendants of the Semitic Adam
were among the Phœnician deities. Thus, the Carthaginians
had a god Yubal, Jubal, who would appear
to have been the sun-god Æsculapius, called “the
fairest of the gods and so, we read in a Phœnician
inscription Ju-Baal—<i>i.e.</i>, beauty of Baal, which Movers
ingeniously interprets Æsculapius—Asmun-Jubal.”
Here, then, adds Bunsen, “is another old Semitic
name attached to a descendant of Lamekh, together
with Adah, Zillah, and Naamah.”<a id="FNanchor_166_166" href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> Hadah, the wife
of Lamekh, as well of Esau, the Phœnician Usov, is
identified with the goddess, worshipped at Babylon as
Hera (Juno), and, notwithstanding Sir Gardner Wil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>kinson’s
dictum to the contrary, her names, Hera,
Hadah, point to a connection with the Egyptian <i>Her
Her</i>, or <i>Hathor</i>, who was the daughter of Seb and
Netpe, as Hera was the daughter of Chronos and
Rhea. The name of the god <i>Kiyun</i>, or Kevan, who
was worshipped by the Hebrews, and who in Syria
was said to devour children, seems, from its connection
with the root <i>kun</i>, to erect, to point to the antediluvian
Kain or Kevan. <i>Kon</i>, derived from the same
root, was, according to Bunsen, a Phœnician designation
of Saturn.<a id="FNanchor_167_167" href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> Even the great Carthaginian sun-god
<i>Melekh</i>, who was also “held in universal honour
throughout Phœnicia,” seems, although Bunsen does
not thus identify him, to be no other than Lamekh,
the father of Noah, in one of the genealogies of
Genesis. We may, perhaps, have in the sacrifices to
the Phœnician deities, when the first-born sons of the
people were offered on his altars, an explanation<a id="FNanchor_168_168" href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> of
the passage in Genesis which has so much puzzled
commentators, where Lamekh is made to declare that
he has “slain a man for his wound, and a youth for
his hurt,” for which, while Cain was avenged seven
times, Lamekh should be avenged seventy times seven
times.<a id="FNanchor_169_169" href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> The Phœnicians had a tradition that Kronos
(Saturn) had sacrificed his own beloved son Yadid,
and some ancient writers said that the human sacrifices
to Moloch were in imitation of this act.<a id="FNanchor_170_170" href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> This reason<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
may not be the correct one for the use of human
sacrifices, but the seventy times seven times in which
Lamekh was avenged may well refer to the abundance
of the victims offered on the altar of the Phœnician
deity.</p>

<p>The priority of the Phallic superstition over “Arkism,”
or rather the existence of that superstition before the
formation of the Deluge legend, is proved, moreover,
by its agreement with the myth of Osiris and Isis.
This agreement forms the central idea of the explanation
of pagan idolatry given by Faber, and yet it conclusively
proves that the Noachian Deluge was simply
a myth, having, like that of Osiris, a Phallic basis.
Bunsen says “the myth of Osiris and Typhon, heretofore
considered as primeval, can now be authoritatively
proved to be of modern date in Egypt—that is to say,
about the thirteenth or fourteenth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>”<a id="FNanchor_171_171" href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> But
it is <i>this</i> version of the Osirian myth which is said to
be founded on the Noachian catastrophe, Typhon or
The Evil Being, the persecutor of Osiris, being the
Waters of the Deluge. The very foundation of the
Hebrew legend is thus cut away, and from the fact,
moreover, that the Egyptians had no tradition of a
great flood, we must seek for another origin for the
legend of which different phases were held by so many
of the peoples of antiquity. The fact of Typhon
(Seth) having been venerated in Egypt to so late a
date as the thirteenth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> is a proof that the
myth, according to which he was the cruel persecutor
of his brother Osiris, must have been of a later origin.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
The primitive form of the myth is easily recognised
when it is known that both Osiris and Typhon (Seth)
were sun-gods. Thus, according to Bunsen, “the myth
of Osiris typifies the solar year, the power of Osiris
is the sun of the lower hemisphere, the winter solstice.
The birth of Horus typifies the vernal equinox—the
victory of Horus, the summer equinox—the inundation
of the Nile. Typhon is the autumnal equinox—Osiris
is slain on the seventeenth of Athyr (November)....
The rule of Typhon lasts from the autumnal
equinox to the middle of December. He reigns twenty-eight
years, or lives as long.”<a id="FNanchor_172_172" href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> Thus the history of
Osiris is “the history of the circle of the year,” and
in his resurrection as Horus we see the sun resuscitating
itself after its temporary eclipse during the winter
solstice. Here Typhon is also a sun-god, his rule
being at the autumnal equinox when the sun has its
full power. This was the deity of the Semites and
of the inhabitants of Lower Egypt, and his scorching
force, doubtless, prepared the Egyptians, who venerated
the milder Osiris, to look with abhorrence on
Typhon-Seth, who had already, probably under the
same influence, become a savage deity, delighting in
burnt offerings and human sacrifices.<a id="FNanchor_173_173" href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> No wonder,
therefore, that when the worshippers of the Semitic
god were driven out of Egypt, the god himself was
treated as an enemy. Thus we are told that the
enemies of Egypt and their gods contended with the
gods of Egypt, who veiled themselves under the heads
of animals in order to save themselves from Typhon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
Moreover, when this Semitic god was thus degraded
and transformed into an Evil Being, he would naturally
come to be looked upon as the enemy of Osiris,
seeing that he was already identified with the autumn
sun, which during the autumnal equinox triumphs over
the sun of Osiris; and we can easily understand how,
if the myth of a Deluge, and the consequent destruction
of all mankind but the father of the renewed human
race, was introduced, Typhon would be the destroying
enemy and Osiris the suffering and restored man-god.</p>

<p>If, as Dr. Faber supposes, the Egyptian myth was
a form of that which relates to the Noachian Deluge,
we can only suppose them to have had a similar basis,
a basis which, from the very circumstances of the
case, must be purely “Phallic.” This explanation is
the only one which is consistent with a peculiarity in
the Hebrew legend which is an insurmountable objection
to its reception as the expression of a literal fact.
We are told by the Mosaic narrative that Jehovah
directed Noah to take with him into the ark “of
fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of
every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two
of every sort.” Now, according to the ordinary
acceptation of the legend, this passage expresses a
simple absurdity, even on the hypothesis of a partial
Deluge. If, however, we read the narrative in a Phallic
sense, and by the ark understand the sacred <i>Argha</i>
of Hindu mythology, the <i>Yoni</i> of Parvati, which, like
the moon in Zoroastrian teaching, carries in <i>itself</i> the
“germs of all things,” we see the full propriety of what
otherwise is incomprehensible. The Elohim “created”
the heavens and the earth, and on its destruction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
the seeds of all things were preserved in the ark to
again cover the earth. Taken in this sense, we see
the reason of the curious analogy which exists in
various points between the Hebrew legends of the
Creation and of the Deluge, this analogy being one of
the grounds on which the hypothesis of the Great
Father as the central idea of all mythologies has been
based. Thus, the primeval ship, the navigation of
which is ascribed to the mythological being, is not
the ark of Noah or Osiris, or the vessel of the
Phœnician Kabiri. It was the moon, the ship of the
sun, in which his seed is supposed to be hidden until
it bursts forth in new life and power. The fact that
the moon was, in early mythologies, a male deity,
almost necessitates, however, that there should have
been another origin for the sacred vessel of Osiris.
This we have in the Hastoreth-<i>karnaim</i>, the cow-goddess,
whose horns represent the lunar ark, and
who, without doubt, was a more primitive deity than
the moon-goddess herself.<a id="FNanchor_174_174" href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> The most primitive type
of all, however, is that of the <i>Argha</i> or <i>Yoni</i> of the
Indian Iswara, which from its name was supposed to
have been turned into a dove.<a id="FNanchor_175_175" href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> Thus, in Noah and
the ark, as in Osiris and the moon, we see simply the
combination of the male and female elements as they
are still represented in the Hindu lingam. The
introduction of the dove into the myth is a curious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
confirmation of this view. For this bird, which, as
“the emblem of love and fruitfulness,” was “consecrated
to Venus, under all her different names, at
Babylon, in Syria, Palestine, and Greece;<a id="FNanchor_176_176" href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> which was
the national banner-sign of the Assyrians, as of the
earlier Sythic empire, whose founders, according to
Hindu tradition, took the name of <i>Jonim</i> or <i>Yoniyas</i>,
and which attended on Janus, a diluvian ‘god of
opening and shutting;’ was simply a type of ‘the
Yoni’ or Jonah, or Navicular feminine principle,”
which was said to have assumed the form of a ship
and a dove.<a id="FNanchor_177_177" href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></p>

<p>In bringing this essay to a close, some mention should
be made of what may be called the <i>modern</i> religions,
Brahminism, Buddhism, and Christianity, seeing that
these still exist as the faiths of great peoples. As to
the first of these, it may be thought that its real
character cannot be ascertained from the present condition
of Hindu belief. It is said that the religion of
the <i>Vedas</i> is very different from that of the <i>Puranas</i>,
which have taken their place. It should be remembered,
however, that these books profess to reproduce
old doctrine, the word “Purana” itself meaning <i>old</i>,
and that Puranas are referred to in one of the Upanishads,
while the <i>Tantras</i>, which contain the principles
of the <i>Sacti Puja</i>, and which are as yet almost unknown
to Europeans, are considered by the Brahmins to be
more ancient than the Puranas themselves.<a id="FNanchor_178_178" href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
origin of the ideas contained in these books is a difficult
question. The germs of both Vishnu-worship
and Siva-worship appear to be found in the Vedas,<a id="FNanchor_179_179" href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">179</a>
and the worship of the linga is undoubtedly referred to
the Mahabharata.<a id="FNanchor_180_180" href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> It is more probable, as thought by
Mr. Fergusson and other late writers, that they are only
indirectly sprung from the primitive Hinduism. The
similarity between Siva-ism and the Santal-worship of
the Great Mountain pointed out by Dr. Hunter is
very remarkable, and this analogy is strengthened by
intermixture in both cases with river-worship.<a id="FNanchor_181_181" href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> There
is no doubt that the Great Mountain is simply a name
for the Phallic emblem, which is the chief form under
which Siva is represented in the numerous temples at
Benares dedicated to his honour. Considering the
position occupied by the serpent as a symbol of life
and indirectly of the male power, we should expect to
find its worship connected to some extent with that of
Siva. Mr. Fergusson, however, declares that it is not
so, and, although this statement requires some qualification,<a id="FNanchor_182_182" href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">182</a>
yet it is certain that the serpent is also inti<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>mately
associated with Vishnu. In explanation of
this fact, Mr. Fergusson remarks: “The Vaishnava
religion is derived from a group of faiths in which the
serpent always played an important part. The eldest
branch of the family was the Naga worship, pure and
simple; out of that arose Buddhism, ... and on its
decline two faiths—at first very similar to one another—rose
from its ashes, the Jaina and the Vaishnava.”
The serpent is almost always found in Jaina temples
as an object of worship, while it appears everywhere
in Vaishnava tradition.<a id="FNanchor_183_183" href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> But elsewhere Mr. Fergusson
tells us that, although Buddhism owed its establishment
to Naga tribes, yet its supporters repressed
the worship of the serpent, elevating tree-worship in
its place.<a id="FNanchor_184_184" href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> It is difficult to understand how the Vaishnavas,
who are worshippers of the female power,<a id="FNanchor_185_185" href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> and
who hate the <i>lingam</i>, can yet so highly esteem the
serpent which has indirectly, at least, reference to the
male principle. Perhaps, however, we may find an
explanation in Mr. Fergusson’s own remarks as to the
character and development of Buddhism. According
to him, Buddhism was chiefly influential among Naga
tribes, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span> “was little more than a revival of the coarser
superstitions of the aboriginal races,<a id="FNanchor_186_186" href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> purified and
refined by the application of Aryan morality, and
elevated by doctrines borrowed from the intellectual
superiority of the Aryan races.<a id="FNanchor_187_187" href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">187</a>” As to its development,
the sculptures on the Sanchi Tope show that at
about the beginning of the Christian era, although the
<i>dagoba</i>, the <i>chakra</i> or wheel, the <i>tree</i>, and other
emblems, were worshipped, the serpent hardly appears;
while at Amravati, three centuries later, this
animal had become equal to Buddha himself.<a id="FNanchor_188_188" href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> Moreover,
there can be no doubt that the <i>lingam</i> was an
emblem of Buddha, as was also the <i>lotus</i>, which
represents the same idea—the conjunction of the male
and female elements, although in a higher sense perfect
wisdom.<a id="FNanchor_189_189" href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> The association of the same ideas is
seen in the noted prayer <i>Om mani padmi hum</i> (“Oh,
the Jewel in the Lotus”), which refers to the birth of
Padmipani from the sacred lotus flower,<a id="FNanchor_190_190" href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> but also,
there can be little doubt, to the phallus and the yoni.
We may suppose, therefore, that whatever the moral
doctrine taught by Gautama, he used the old Phallic
symbols, although it may be with a peculiar application.
If the opinion expressed by Mr. Fergusson as
to the introduction into India of the Vaishnava faith
by an early immigrant race be correct, it must have
existed in the time of Gautama, and indeed the Ion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>-ism
of Western Asia is traditionally connected with
India itself at a very early date,<a id="FNanchor_191_191" href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> although probably
the early centre of Ion-ism, the worship of the Dove or
Yoni, was, as Bryant supposes, in Chaldea.<a id="FNanchor_192_192" href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> We see
no trace, however, in Buddhism proper of <i>Sacti
Puja</i>, and I would suggest that, instead of abolishing
either, Gautama substituted for the separate symbols of
the linga and the yoni, the association of the two in
the <i>lingam</i>. If this were so, we can well understand
how, on the fall of Buddhism, Siva-worship<a id="FNanchor_193_193" href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> may have
retained this compound symbol, with many of the old
Naga ideas, although with little actual reference to
the serpent itself, other than as a symbol of life and
power; while, on the other hand, the Vaishnavas
may have reverted to the primitive worship of the
female principle, retaining a remembrance of the early
serpent associations in the use of the <i>Sesha</i>, the
heavenly naga with seven heads<a id="FNanchor_194_194" href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> figured on the Amravati
sculptures. It is possible, however, that there
may be another ground of opposition between the
followers of Vishnu and Siva. Mr. Fergusson points
out that, notwithstanding the peculiarly Phallic symbolism
of the latter deity, “the worship of Siva is too
severe, too stern for the softer emotions of love, and all
his temples are quite free from any allusion to it.” It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
is far different with the Vaishnavas, whose temples
“are full of sexual feelings generally expressed in the
grossest terms.”<a id="FNanchor_195_195" href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> Siva, in fact, is specially a god of
intellect, typified by his being three-eyed, and although
terrible as the resistless destroyer, yet the recreator of
all things in perfect wisdom;<a id="FNanchor_196_196" href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> while Vishnu has relation
rather to the lower type of wisdom which was
distinctive of the Assyrians, among ancient peoples,
and which has so curious a connection with the female
principle. Hence the <i>shell</i> or <i>conch</i> is peculiar to
Vishnu, while the <i>linga</i> belongs to Siva.<a id="FNanchor_197_197" href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> Gautama
combined the simpler feminine phase of religion with
the more masculine intellectual type, symbolising this
union by the lingam and other analogous emblems.
The followers of Siva have, however, adopted the
combined symbol in the place of the linga alone,
thus approaching more nearly than the Vaishnavas
to the idea of the founder of modern Buddhism. Gautama
himself, nevertheless, was most probably only
the restorer of an older faith, according to which perfect
wisdom was to be found only in the typical combination
of the male and female principles in nature.
The real explanation of the connection between
Buddhism and Siva-ism has perhaps, however, yet to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
be given<a id="FNanchor_198_198" href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">198</a>. The worship of the serpent-god is not
unknown, even at the present day, in the very stronghold
of Siva-ism,<a id="FNanchor_199_199" href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> reminding us of the early spread of
Buddhism among Naga tribes. In the “crescent surmounted
by a pinnacle similar to the pointed end of a
spear,” which decorates the roofs of the Tibetan
monasteries,<a id="FNanchor_200_200" href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> we undoubtedly have a reproduction of
the so-called trident of Siva. This instrument is given
also to <i>Sani</i>, the Hindu Saturn, who is represented as
encompassed by two serpents,<a id="FNanchor_201_201" href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> and hence the pillar
symbol of this primeval deity we may well suppose to
be reproduced in the linga of the Indian Phallic god.<a id="FNanchor_202_202" href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">202</a>
But the pillar symbol is not wanting to Buddhism
itself. The columns said to have been raised by Asoka
have a reference to the pillars of Seth. The remains
of an ancient pillar supposed to be a Buddhist <i>Lat</i>
is still to be seen at Benares,<a id="FNanchor_203_203" href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> the word <i>Lat</i> being
merely another form of the name <i>Tet</i>, <i>Set</i>, or <i>Sat</i>,
given to the Phœnician Semitic or deity. In the central
pillar of the so-called Druidical circles we have doubtless
a reference to the same primitive superstition, the
idea intended to be represented being the combination
of the male and female principles.<a id="FNanchor_204_204" href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">204</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>

<p>In conclusion, it must be said that Christianity
itself is certainly not without the Phallic element.
Reference may be made to the important place taken
in Christian dogma by the “fall,” which has been
shown to have had a purely Phallic foundation, and to
the peculiar position assigned to Mary, as the Virgin
Mother of God.<a id="FNanchor_205_205" href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> It must not be forgotten, however,
that, whatever may have been the primitive idea on
which these dogmas are based, it had received a totally
fresh aspect at the hands of those from whom the
founders of Christianity received it.<a id="FNanchor_206_206" href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> As to symbols,
too, these were employed by the Christians in the
later signification given to them by the followers of
the ancient faiths. Thus the fish and the cross symbols
originally embodied the idea of <i>generation</i>, but
afterwards that of <i>life</i>, and it was in this sense that they
were applied to Christ.<a id="FNanchor_207_207" href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> The most evidently Phallic
representation used by the Christian Iconographers is
undoubtedly the <i>aureole</i>, or <i>vesica piscis</i>, which is
elliptical in form and contained the figure of Christ—Mary
herself, however, being sometimes represented
in the aureole, glorified as Jesus Christ.<a id="FNanchor_208_208" href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> Probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
the <i>nimbus</i> also is of Phallic significance, for, although
generally circular, it was sometimes triangular, square,
&amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_209_209" href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> The name of Jehovah is inscribed within a
radiating triangle.<a id="FNanchor_210_210" href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> Didron gives an illustration of
St. John the Evangelist with a circular nimbus, surmounted
by two sun-flowers, emblems of the sun, an
idea which, says Didron, “reminds us of the Egyptian
figures, from the heads of which two lotus-flowers
rise in a similar manner.”<a id="FNanchor_211_211" href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> There is also a curious
representation in the same work of the <i>Divine hand</i>
with the thumb and two forefingers outstretched,
resting on a cruciform nimbus.<a id="FNanchor_212_212" href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> In Egypt the hand
having the fingers thus placed was a symbol of Isis,
and, from its accompaniments, there can be no doubt,
notwithstanding the mesmeric character ascribed to it
by Ennemoser,<a id="FNanchor_213_213" href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> that it had an essentially Phallic
origin, although it may ultimately have been used to
signify life. There can be no question, however, that,
whatever may be thought as to the nature of its
symbols,<a id="FNanchor_214_214" href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> the basis of Christianity is more emotional
than that of any other religion now existing.
Reference has been made to the presence in Hebraic
theology of an idea of God—that of a Father—antagonistic
to the Phœnician notion of the “Lord of
Heaven.” We have the same idea repeated in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
Christ’s teaching, its distinctive characteristic being
the recognition of God as the Universal Father—the
Great Parent of mankind, who had sent His son into
the world that he might reconcile it unto Himself.
It is in the character of a forgiving parent that Christians
are taught to view God, when He is not lost
sight of in the presence of Christ, of whom the
church is declared to be the bride. In Christianity
we see the final expression of the primitive worship
of the father as the head of the family—the generator—as
the result of an instinctive reasoning process
leading up from the particular to the universal—with
which, however, the dogma of the “fall” and its consequences—deduced
so strangely from a Phallic legend—have
been incorporated.<a id="FNanchor_215_215" href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> As a religion of the emotions,
the position of Christianity is perfectly unassailable.
As a system of rational faith, however, it
is otherwise; and the tendency of the present age is
just the reverse of that which took place among the
Hebrews—the substitution of a Heavenly King for a
Divine Father. In fact, modern science is doing its
best to effect for primitive fetishism, or demon-worship,
what Christianity has done for Phallic-worship—generalise
the powers of nature and make of God a Great
Unknowable Being, who, like the Elohim, of the Mosaic
Cosmogony, in some mysterious manner, causes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
all things to appear at a word. This cannot, however,
be the real religion of the future. If God is to be
worshipped at all, the Heavenly King and the Divine
Father must be combined as a single term, and He
must be viewed, not as the unknowable cause of
being, but as the great source of all being, who may
be known in nature—the expression of his life and
energy, and in man who was “created” in his own
image.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—M. François Lenormant, in the seventh
edition of his “Histoire ancienne de l’Orient”
(T. i., p. 91), after considering the traditions of a
great deluge preserved by various peoples, concludes
that “the biblical deluge, far from being a myth, has
been a real and historical fact, which has struck the
ancestors of at least the Aryan or Indo-European, the
Semitic or Syro-Arab, and the Hamitic or Kouschite
races—that is, the three great civilised races of the
ancient world, before the ancestors of these races were
separated, and in the Asiatic country which they
inhabited together.” The authority of M. Lenormant
is great, but preference must be given on this point to
the arguments of M. Dupuis, who, in his “Origine de
tous des Cultes” (T. iii., p. 176, <i>et seq.</i>), has almost
certainly proved the astronomical character of what
he terms the “fiction sacerdotale,” which, however,
may have originated with the common ancestors of
the three races referred to by M. Lenormant.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a><br />

<small>THE ORIGIN OF SERPENT-WORSHIP.</small></h2>


<p>The subject to be discussed in the present chapter
is one of the most fascinating that can engage the
attention of anthropologists. It is remarkable, however,
that although so much has been written in
relation to it, we are still almost in the dark as to the
origin of the superstition in question. The student of
mythology knows that certain ideas were associated
by the peoples of antiquity with the serpent, and that
it was the favourite symbol of particular deities; but
why that animal rather than any other was chosen for
the purpose is yet uncertain. The facts being well known,
however, I shall dwell on them only so far as may be
necessary to support the conclusions based upon them.</p>

<p>We are indebted to Mr. Fergusson for bringing
together a large array of facts, showing the extraordinary
range which serpent-worship had among
ancient nations. It is true that he supposes it not to
have been adopted by any nation belonging to the
Semitic or Aryan stock; the serpent-worship of India
and Greece originating, as he believes, with older
peoples. However this may be, the superstition was
certainly not unknown to either Aryans or Semites.
The brazen serpent of the Hebrew exodus was
destroyed in the reign of Hezekiah, owing to the
idolatry to which it gave rise. In the mythology of
the Chaldeans, from whom the Assyrians seem to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
have sprung, the serpent occupied a most important
position. Among the allied Phœnicians and Egyptians
it was one of the most divine symbols. In
Greece, Hercules was said “to have been the progenitor
of the whole race of serpent-worshipping
Scythians, through his intercourse with the serpent
Echidna;” and when Minerva planted the sacred
olive on the Acropolis of Athens, she placed it under
the care of the serpent-deity Erechthonios. As to
the Latins, Mr. Fergusson remarks that “Ovid’s
‘Metamorphoses’ are full of passages referring to the
important part which the serpent performed in all the
traditions of classic mythology.” The superstitions
connected with that animal are supposed not to have
existed among the ancient Gauls and Germans; but
this is extremely improbable, considering that it
appears to have been known to the British Celts and
to the Gothic inhabitants of Scandinavia. In Eastern
Europe there is no doubt that the serpent superstition
was anciently prevalent, and Mr. Fergusson refers to
evidence proving that “both trees and serpents were
worshipped by the peasantry in Esthonia and Finland
within the limits of the present century, and even
with all the characteristics possessed by the old faith
when we first became acquainted with it.”</p>

<p>The serpent entered largely into the mythology of
the ancient Persians, as it does into that of the
Hindus. In India it is associated with both Siva-ism
and Vishnuism, although its actual worship perhaps
belonged rather to the aboriginal tribes among whom
Buddhism is thought by recent writers to have originated.
The modern home of the superstition,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
however, is Western Africa, where the serpent is not
merely considered sacred, but is actually worshipped
as divine. On the other side of the Indian Ocean
traces of the same superstition are met with among
the peoples of the Indian islands and of Polynesia,
and also in China. The evidences of serpent-worship
on the American Continent have long engaged the
attention of archæologists, who have found it to be
almost universal, under one form or another, among
the aboriginal tribes. That animal was sculptured on
the temples of Mexico and Peru, and its form is said
by Mr. Squier to be of frequent occurrence among the
mounds of Wisconsin. The most remarkable of the
symbolic earthworks of North America is the great
serpent mound of Adam’s county, Ohio, the convolutions
of which extend to a length of 1,000 feet. At
the Edinburgh meeting of the British Association, in
1871, Mr. Phené gave an account of his discovery in
Argyllshire of a similar mound several hundred feet
long, and about fifteen feet high by thirty feet broad,
tapering gradually to the tail, the head being surmounted
by a circular cairn, which he supposes to
answer to the solar disc above the head of the Egyptian
uræus, the position of which, with head erect,
answers to the form of the Oban serpent-mound. This
discovery is of great interest, and its author is probably
justified in assuming that the mound was connected with
serpent-worship. It may be remarked, in evidence of
the existence of such structures in other parts of the old
world, that the hero of one of the Yaçnas of the Zend
Avesta is made to rest on what he thinks is a bank,
but which he finds to be a great green snake, doubt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>less
a serpent-mound. Another ancient reference to
these structures is made by Iphicrates, who, according
to Bryant, “related that in Mauritania there were
dragons of such extent, that grass grew upon their
backs.”</p>

<p>Let us now see what ideas have been associated
with the serpent by various peoples. Mr. Fergusson
mentions the curious fact that “the chief characteristic
of the serpent throughout the East in all ages seems
to have been their power over the wind and rain.”
According to Colonel Meadows Taylor, in the Indian
Deccan, at the present day, offerings are made to the
village divinities (of whom the nâg, or snake, is always
one) at spring time and harvest for rain or fine weather,
and also in time of cholera or other diseases or pestilence.
So, among the Chinese, the dragon is regarded
as the giver of rain, and in time of drought offerings are
made to it. In the spring and fall of the year it is
one of the objects worshipped, by command of the
Emperor, by certain mandarins. The Chinese notion
of the serpent or dragon dwelling above the clouds in
spring to give rain reminds us of the Aryan myth of
Vritra, or Ahi, the throttling snake, or dragon with
three heads, who hides away the rain-clouds, but who
is slain by Indra, the beneficent giver of rain. “Whenever,”
says Mr. Cox,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span> “the rain is shut up in the clouds,
the dark power is in revolt against Dyaus and Indra.
In the rumblings of the thunder, while the drought
still sucks out the life of the earth, are heard the
mutterings of their hateful enemy. In the lightning
flashes which precede the outburst of the pent-up
waters are seen the irresistible spears of the god, who
is attacking the throttling serpent in his den; and in
the serene heaven which shone out when the deluging
clouds are passed away, men beheld the face of the
mighty deity who was their friend.” Mr. Cox elsewhere
remarks that Vritra, “the enemy of Indra, reappears
in all the dragons, snakes, or worms slain by
all the heroes of Aryan mythology.”</p>

<p>Whether the great serpent be the giver or the storer
of rain, the Aryans, like all Eastern peoples, suppose it
to have power over the clouds. This, however, is
only one of its attributes. It is thought to have power
over the wind as well as the rain, and this also is confirmed
by reference to Aryan mythology. Mr. Cox
has well shown that Hermes is “the air in motion, or
wind, varying in degree from the soft breath of a
summer breeze to the rage of the growing hurricane.”
In these more violent moods he is represented by the
Maruts, the “crushers” or “grinders,” who are also
the children of Rudra, the “Father of the Winds,”
and himself the “wielder of the thunderbolt” and the
“mightiest of the mighty.” Rudra is also “the
robber, the cheat, the deceiver, the master thief,” and
in this character both he and Hermes agree with the
cloud-thief Vritra.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that in the Mahabharata,
Rudra, like Hercules, is described as the “destroyer
of serpents,” he is in the same poem identified with
Mahadeva, and hence he is evidently the same as Siva,
who has the title of King of Serpents. The primitive
character of Siva, as the Vedic Rudra, is now almost
lost, but the identity of the two deities may be supported
by reference to an incident related in the myth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
of Hermes and Apollo. It is said that, in return for
the sweet-sounding lyre, Apollo gave to Hermes the
magical “three-leafed rod of wealth and happiness.”
Sometimes this rod was entwined with serpents instead
of fillets, and there is no difficulty in recognising in it
the well-known emblem of Siva, which also is sometimes
encircled by serpents. It can be shown that the
Hindu deity is a form of Saturn, one of the Semitic
names for whom was Set or Seth. It was the serpent-symbol
of this God<a id="FNanchor_216_216" href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> which was said to have been
elevated in the wilderness for the healing of the people
bitten by serpents, and curiously enough Rudra (Siva)
was called not only the <i>bountiful</i>, the <i>strong</i>, but the
<i>healer</i>. The later Egyptian title of the god Set was
Typhon, of whom Mr. Breal says that “Typhon is the
monster who obscures the heaven, a sort of Greek
Văritra.” The myth of Indra and Vritra is reproduced
in Latin mythology as that of Hercules and Căcus.
Căcus also is analogous to Typhon, and as the former
is supposed to have taken his name from, or given it
to, a certain wind which had the power of clothing
itself with clouds, so the latter bore the same name as
a very destructive wind which was much dreaded by
the Phœnicians and Egyptians. Moreover, the name
Typhon was given by the Egyptians to anything tempestuous,
and hence to the ocean; and in Hebrew the
allied word “Suph” denotes a “whirlwind.” There
is another point of contact, however, between Siva
and the god Set or Typhon, who was known to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
Egyptians also as the serpent Aphôphis, or the giant.
An ancient writer states that one of the names of El,
or Chronos, was Typhon, and the serpent and pillar
symbols of the Phœnician deity confirm the identification
between Set or Saturn, and the Siva of the Hindu
Pantheon.</p>

<p>One of the leading ideas connected with the serpent
was, as we have seen, its power over the rain, but
another equally influential was its connection with
health. Mr. Fergusson remarks that “when we first
meet with serpent-worship, either in the wilderness of
Sinai, the groves of Epidaurus, or in the Sarmatian
huts, the serpent is always the Agatho-dæmon, the
bringer of health and good fortune.”<a id="FNanchor_217_217" href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> The Agatho-dæmon,
which in ancient Egypt presided over the
affairs of men as the guardian spirit of their houses,<a id="FNanchor_218_218" href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">218</a>
was the Asp of Rânno, the snake-headed goddess
who is represented as nursing the young princes.
That the idea of health was intimately associated with
the serpent is shown by the crown formed of the asp,
or sacred <i>Thermuthis</i>, having been given particularly to
Isis, a goddess of life and healing. It was also the
symbol of other deities with the like attributes. Thus
on a papyri it encircles the figure of Harpocrates, who
was identified with the serpent god Æsculapius; while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
not only was a great serpent kept alive in the temple
of Serapis, but on later monuments this deity is represented
by a great serpent, with or without a human
head. Sanchoniathon says of that animal—“It is
long-lived, and has the quality not only of putting off
its old age and assuming a second youth, but of
receiving at the same time an augmentation of its size
and strength.” The serpent, therefore, was a fit emblem
of Rudra, “the healer;” and the gift which
Apollo presented to Mercury could be entwined by
no more appropriate object than the animal which was
supposed to be able to give the health without which
even Mercury’s magic-staff could not confer wealth
and happiness. It is remarkable that a Moslem saint
of Upper Egypt is still thought to appear under the
form of a serpent, and to cure the diseases which
afflict the pilgrims to his shrine.</p>

<p>Ramahavaly, one of the four national idols of the
Malagasy, bears a curious analogy to the serpent
gods of wisdom and healing. One of his titles is
<i>Rabiby</i>, signifying “animal,” and denoting “the god
of beasts;” and his emissaries are the serpents which
abide in Madagascar, and are looked upon with superstitious
fear by the inhabitants. Ramahavaly is, moreover,
regarded as the Physician of Imerina, and is
thought to preserve from, or expel, epidemic diseases.
Mr. Ellis says that he is sometimes described<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span> “as
god, sacred, powerful, and almighty; who kills and
makes alive; who heals the sick, and prevents diseases
and pestilence; who can cause thunder and lightning
to strike their victims or prevent their fatality; can
cause rain in abundance when wanted, or can withhold
it so as to ruin the crops of rice. He is also
celebrated for his knowledge of the past and future,
and for his capacity of discovering whatever is hidden
or concealed.”</p>

<p>It is probable that the association with the serpent
of the idea of healing arose from the still earlier
recognition of that animal as a symbol of life. We
have already referred to the representations in the
Egyptian temples of the young princes being nursed
by a woman having the head of an asp. It is interesting
to find that in India at the present day serpent-worship
is expressly resorted to on behalf of
children, and “the first hair of a child which is shaved
off when it has passed teething and other infantine
ailments is frequently dedicated to a serpent.” This
animal in both cases is treated as the guardian of life,
and therefore the crown given to Egyptian sovereigns
and divinities was very properly formed of the
asp of Rânno. Another snake-headed Egyptian goddess
has the name <i>Hih</i> or <i>Hoh</i>, and Sir Gardner Wilkinson
mentions that the Coptic word <i>Hof</i> signifies
the viper, analogous to the <i>hye</i> of the Arabs. The
Arabic word <i>hiya</i>, indeed, means both life and a serpent.
This connection is supported by the association,
already pointed out, between the serpent and
the gods of the life-giving wind, and by the fact that
these also possess the pillar symbol of life. This
belongs as well to Siva the destroyer, the preserver,
and the creator, as to Set or Saturn, to Thoth-Hermes,
and El or Chronos. Both the serpent and the pillar
were assigned also to many of the personifications of the
sun, the deified source of earthly life. Probably the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
well-known figure representing the serpent with its tail
in its mouth was intended to symbolise endless life
rather than eternity, an idea which does not appear to
have been associated with that animal by the Egyptians.
Agreeably with this view, Horapollo affirms
that Kneph-Agatho-dæmon denoted immortality.</p>

<p>One of the best-known attributes of the serpent is
wisdom. The Hebrew tradition of the fall speaks of
that animal as the most subtle of the beasts of the
field; and the founder of Christianity tells his disciples
to be as wise as serpents, though as harmless as
doves. Among the ancients the serpent was consulted
as an oracle, and Maury points out that it
played an important part in the life of several celebrated
Greek diviners in connection with the knowledge
of the language of birds, which many of the
ancients believed to be the souls of the dead. The
serpent was associated with Apollo and Athené, the
Grecian deities of wisdom, as well as with the
Egyptian Kneph,<a id="FNanchor_219_219" href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> the ram-headed god from whom the
Gnostics are sometimes said to have derived their idea
of the <i>Sophia</i>. This personification of divine wisdom
is undoubtedly represented on Gnostic gems under
the form of the serpent. In Hindu mythology there
is the same association between the animal and the
idea of wisdom. Siva, as Sambhu, is the patron of
the Brahmanic order, and, as shown by his being
three-eyed, is essentially a god possessing high intellectual
attributes. Vishnu also is a god of wisdom,
but of the somewhat lower type which is distinctive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
of the worshippers of truth under its feminine aspect.
The connection between wisdom and the serpent is
best seen, however, in the Hindu legends as to the
Nagas. Mr. Fergusson remarks that “the Naga
appears everywhere in Vaishnava tradition. There is
no more common representation of Vishnu<a id="FNanchor_220_220" href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> than as
reposing on the Sesha, the celestial seven-headed snake,
contemplating the creation of the world. It was by
his assistance that the ocean was churned and Amrita
produced, He everywhere spreads his protecting
hood over the god or his avatars; and in all instances
it is the seven-headed heavenly Naga, not the earthly
cobra of Siva.” The former animal, no doubt, is
especially symbolical of wisdom, and it is probably
owing to his intellectual attributes, rather than to his
destructive or creative power, that Siva is sometimes
styled the King of Serpents. The Upanishads refer
to the science of serpents, by which is meant the
wisdom of the mysterious Nagas, who, according to
Buddhistic legend, reside under Mount Méru, and
in the waters of the terrestrial world. One of the
sacred books of the Tibetan Buddhists is fabled to
have been received from the Nagas, who, says Schlagentweit,
are “fabulous creatures of the nature of serpents,
who occupy a place among the beings superior
to man, and are regarded as protectors of the law of
the Buddha. To these spiritual beings Sâkyamuni is
said to have taught a more philosophical religious
system than to men, who were not sufficiently advanced
to understand it at the time of his appearance.” So
far as this has any historical basis, it can mean only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
that Gautama taught his most secret doctrines to the
Nagas, or aboriginal serpent-worshippers, who were
the first to accept his teaching, and whose religious
ideas had probably much in common with those of
Gautama himself. Mr. Fergusson refers to the fact that
a king of the Naga race was reigning in Magadha when
Buddha was born in 623 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>; and he adds that the
dissemination of his religion “is wholly due to the
accident of its having been adopted by the low caste
kings of Magadha, and to its having been elevated by
one of them to the rank of the religion of the state.”
It would appear, indeed, that according to a Hindu
legend, Gautama himself had a serpent lineage.</p>

<p>The “serpent-science” of Hindu legend has a curious
parallel in Phœnician mythology. The invention of
the Phœnician written character is referred to the god Taaut
or Thoth, whose snake-symbol bears his name
Têt, and is used to represent the ninth letter of the
alphabet (<i>teta</i>), which in the oldest Phœnician character
has the form of the snake curling itself up. Philo
thus explains the form of the letter <i>theta</i>, and that
the god from whom it took its name was designated
by the Egyptians as a snake curled up, with its head
turned inwards. Philo adds that the letters of the
Phœnician alphabet “are those formed by means of
serpents; afterwards, when they built temples, they
assigned them a place in the adytums, instituted
various ceremonies and solemnities in honour of them,
and adored them as the supreme gods, the rulers of
the universe.” Bunsen thinks the sense of this passage
is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span> “that the forms and movements of serpents
were employed in the invention of the oldest letters,
which represent the gods.” He says, however, that
“the alphabet does not tally at all with the Phœnician
names,” and the explanation given by Philo, although
curious as showing the ideas anciently associated with
the serpent, is reliable only so far as it confirms the
connection between that animal and the inventor of
the written characters. According to another tradition,
the ancient theology of Egypt was said to have
been given by the Agatho-dæmon, who was the benefactor
of all mankind.</p>

<p>The account given of the serpent by Sanchoniathon,
as cited by Eusebius, is worth repetition as showing
the peculiar notions anciently current in connection
with that animal. The Phœnician writer says:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
“Taautus first attributed something of the divine
nature to the serpent and the serpent tribe, in which
he was followed by the Phœnicians and Egyptians;
for this animal was esteemed by him to be the most
inspired of all the reptiles, and of a fiery nature, inasmuch
as it exhibits an incredible celerity, moving by
its spirit without either hands or feet, or any of those
external members by which other animals effect their
motion, and in its progress it assumes a variety of
forms, moving in a spiral course, and darting forwards
with whatever degree of swiftness it pleases. It is,
moreover, long-lived, and has the quality not only of
putting off its old age, and assuming a second youth,
but of receiving at the same time an augmentation of
its size and strength, and when it has fulfilled the appointed
measure of its existence it consumes itself, as
Taautus has laid down in the sacred books; upon
which account this animal is introduced in the sacred
rites and mysteries.” In India at the present day
some Brahmans always keep the skin of a nâg, or
snake, in one of their sacred books, probably from
some idea connected with the casting by the serpent
of its skin referred to in the preceding passage.</p>

<p>We have now seen that the serpent was anciently
the symbol of wisdom, life, and healing, and also
that it was thought to have power over the wind
and rain. This last attribute is easily understood
when the importance of rain in the east is considered,
and the ideas associated by the ancients with the air
and moisture are remembered. The Hebrew tradition
which speaks of the creative spirit moving over the
face of the waters embodies those ideas, according to
which the water contains the elements of life and the
wind is the vivifying principle. The attribute of
wisdom cannot so easily be connected with that of
life. The power of healing is certainly an evidence
of the possession of wisdom,<a id="FNanchor_221_221" href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> but as it is only one
phase of it, probably the latter attribute was antecedent
to the former, or at least it may have had an
independent origin. What this origin was may
perhaps be explained by reference to certain other
ideas very generally entertained in relation to the
serpent. Among various African tribes this animal is
viewed with great veneration, under the belief that it
is often the re-embodiment of a deceased ancestor.
This notion appears to be prevalent also among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
Hindus, who, like the Kafirs, will never kill a serpent,
although it is usually regarded with more dislike than
veneration. Mr. Squier remarks that “many of the
North American tribes entertain a superstitious regard
for serpents, and particularly for the rattlesnake.<a id="FNanchor_222_222" href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">222</a>
Though always avoiding they never destroy it, ‘lest,’
says Barham, ‘the spirit of the reptile should excite
its kindred to revenge.’” Mr. Squier adds that,
“according to Adair, this fear was not unmingled
with veneration. Charlevoix states that the Natchez
had the figure of a rattlesnake, carved from wood,
placed among other objects upon the altar of their
temple, to which they paid great honour. Heckwelder
relates that the Linni Linape called the rattlesnake
‘grandfather,’ and would on no account allow it
to be destroyed. Hemy states that the Indians around
Lake Huron had a similar superstition, and also designated
the rattlesnake as their ‘grandfather.’ He also
mentions instances in which offerings of tobacco were
made to it, and its parental care solicited for the party
performing the sacrifice. Carver also mentions an
instance of similar regard on the part of a Menominee
Indian, who carried a rattlesnake constantly with
him, ‘treating it as a deity, and calling it his great
father.’”</p>

<p>The most curious notion, however, is that of the
Mexicans, who always represented the first woman,
whose name was translated by the old Spanish writers
“the woman of our flesh,” as accompanied by a great
male serpent. The serpent is the sun-god <i>Tonacatle-coatl</i>,
the principal deity of the Mexican Pantheon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
and his female companion, the goddess mother of mankind,
has the title <i>cihua-cohuatl</i>, which signifies
“woman of the serpent.” With the Peruvians, also,
the principal deity was the serpent-sun, whose wife,
the female serpent, gave birth to a boy and a girl
from whom all mankind were said to be descended.
It is remarkable that the serpent origin thus ascribed
to the human race is not confined to the aborigines of
America. According to Herodotus, the primeval
mother of the Scyths was a monster, half woman and
half serpent. This reminds us of the serpent parentage
ascribed to various personages of classical antiquity.<a id="FNanchor_223_223" href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">223</a>
Among the Semites, Zohák, the traditional Arabian
conqueror of Central Asia, is represented as having
two snakes growing at his back; and Mr. Bruce mentions
that the line of the Abyssinian kings begins with
“The Serpent,” <i>Arwe</i>, who is said to have reigned at
Axum for 400 years, showing that the royal descent
was traced from this animal. From the position
assigned to the dragon in China, it probably was
formerly thought to stand in a similar relation to the
Emperor, of whom it is the special symbol.</p>

<p>The facts cited prove that the serpent superstition
is intimately connected with ancestor-worship, probably
originating among uncultured tribes, who, struck
by the noiseless movement and the activity of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
serpent, combined with its peculiar gaze and power of
casting its skin, viewed it as a spirit embodiment.
As such, it would be supposed to have the superior
wisdom and power ascribed to the denizens of the
invisible world, and from this would originate also
the ascription to it of the power over life and health,
and over the moisture on which those benefits are
dependent. The serpent-spirit may, however, have
made its appearance for a good or a bad purpose, to
confer a benefit or to inflict punishment for the misdeeds
of the living. The notion of there being good
and evil serpent-spirits would thus naturally arise.
Among ancestor-worshipping peoples, however, the
serpent would be viewed as a good being who busied
himself about the interests of the tribe to which he
had once belonged. When the simple idea of a spirit-ancestor
was transformed into that of the Great Spirit,
the father of the race, the attributes of the serpent would
be enlarged. The common ancestor would be relegated
to the heavens, and that which was necessary
to the life and well-being of his people would be
supposed to be under his care. Hence the great
serpent was thought to have power over the rain and
the hurricane, with the latter of which he was probably
often identified.</p>

<p>When the serpent was thus transferred to the atmosphere,
and the superstition lost its simple character
as a phase of ancestor-worship, its most natural association
would be with the solar cult. It is not surprising,
therefore, to find that <i>Quetzalcoatl</i>, the divine
benefactor of the Mexicans, was an incarnation of the
serpent-sun <i>Tonacatlcoatl</i>, who thus became the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
father, as the female serpent <i>Cihua-coatl</i> was the great
mother, of the human race. It is an interesting
inquiry how far the sun-gods of other peoples partook
of this double character. Bunsen has a remarkable
passage bearing on the serpent nature of those deities.
He says that “Esmun-Esculapius is strictly a Phœnician
god. He was especially worshipped at Berytus.
At Carthage he was called the highest god, together
with Astarté and Hercules. At Babylon, according
to the above genealogy of Bel, Apollo corresponded
to him. As the snake-god he must actually be Hermes,
in Phœnician Têt, Taautes.... In an earlier stage of
cosmogonical consciousness he is Agatho-dæmon-Sôs,
whom Lepsius has shown to be the third god in the
first order of the Egyptian Pantheon.” The serpent
deity who was thus known under so many forms was
none other than the sun-god Set or Saturn, who has
already been identified with Siva and other deities
having the attributes usually ascribed to the serpent.
Bunsen asserts that Set is common to all the Semites
and Chaldeans, as he was to the Egyptians, but that
“his supposed identity with Saturn is not so old as his
identity with the sun-god, as Sirius (Sôthis), because
the sun has the greatest power when it is in Sirius.”
Elsewhere the same writer says that “the Oriento-Egyptian
conception of Typhon-Set was that of a
drying-up parching heat. Set is considered as the
sun-god when he has reached his zenith, the god of
the summer sun.”</p>

<p>The solar<a id="FNanchor_224_224" href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> character of the serpent-god appears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
therefore to be placed beyond doubt. But what was
the relation in which he was supposed to stand to the
human race? Bunsen, to whose labours I am so much
indebted, remarks that Seth “appears gradually among
the Semites as the background of their religious consciousness,”
and not merely was he “the primitive god
of northern Egypt and Palestine,” but his genealogy
as “the Seth of Genesis, the father of Enoch (the man),
must be considered as originally running parallel with
that derived from the Elohim, Adam’s father.” Seth
is thus the divine ancestor of the Semites, a character
in which, but in relation to other races, the solar deities
generally agree with him. The kings and priests of
ancient peoples claimed this divine origin, and “children
of the sun” was the title of the members of the
sacred caste. When the actual ancestral character of
the deity is hidden he is regarded as “the father of his
people” and their divine benefactor. He is the introducer
of agriculture, the inventor of arts and sciences,
and the civiliser of mankind; “characteristics,” says
Faber, “which every nation ascribed to the first of
their gods or the oldest of their kings.” This was true
of Thoth, Saturn, and other analogous deities, and the
Adam of Hebrew tradition was the father of agriculture,
as his representative Noah was the introducer of
the vine.</p>

<p>Elsewhere I have endeavoured to show that the
name of the great ancestor of Hebrew tradition has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
been preserved by certain peoples who may thus be
classed together as Adamites. He appears, indeed, to
be the recognised legendary ancestor of the members
of that division of mankind whose primeval home we
can scarcely doubt was in Central Asia, answering in
this respect to the Seth of the Semites. According to
the tradition, however, as handed down to us by the
Hebrews, Seth himself was the son of Adam. From
this, it would seem to follow that, as Seth was the
serpent sun-god (the Agatho-dæmon), the legendary
ancestor of the Adamites must himself have partaken of
the same character. Strange as this idea may appear it
is not without warrant. We have already seen that the
Mexicans ascribed that nature to <i>Tonacatlcoatl</i> and his
wife, the mother of mankind, and that a similar notion
was entertained by various peoples of the old world.
The Chaldean god <i>Héa</i> who, as the “teacher of mankind,”
and the “lord of understanding,” answers
exactly to the divine benefactor of the race before
referred to, was “figured by the great serpent which
occupies so conspicuous a place among the symbols of
the gods on the black stones recording Babylonian
benefactions.” The name of the god is connected with
the Arabic <i>Hiya</i>, which signifies a serpent as well as
life, and Sir Henry Rawlinson says that “there are
very strong grounds indeed for connecting him with
the serpent of Scripture, and with the Paradisaical
traditions of the tree of knowledge and the tree of life.”
The god Héa was, therefore, the serpent revealer
of knowledge, answering in some respects to the
serpent of the fall. He was, however, the Agatho-dæmon,
and in the earlier form of the legend doubt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>less
answered to the great human ancestor himself. It
is curious that, according to Rabbinical tradition, Cain
was the son, not of Adam, but of the serpent-spirit
Asmodeus, who is the same as the Persian Ahriman,
“the great serpent with two feet.”<a id="FNanchor_225_225" href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> In the name of
Eve, the mother of mankind, we have, indeed, direct
reference to the supposed serpent-nature of our first
parents. Clemens Alexandrinus long since remarked
that the name <i>Hevia</i>, aspirated, signifies a female
serpent. The name Eve is evidently connected with
the same Arabic root as that which we have seen to
mean both “life” and “a serpent,” and the Persians
appear to have called the constellation <i>Serpens</i> “the
little Ava,” that is <i>Eve</i>, a title which is still given to it
by the Arabs. But if Eve was the serpent mother,
Adam must have been the serpent father. In the old
Akkad tongue <i>Ad</i> signifies “a father,” and the mythical
personages with whom Adam is most nearly allied,
such as Seth or Saturn, Taaut or Thoth, and others,
were serpent deities. Such would seem to have been
the case also with the deities whose names show a close
formal resemblance to that of Adam. Thus the original
name of Hercules was <i>Sandan</i> or <i>Adanos</i>, and
Hercules, like the allied god Mars, was undoubtedly
often closely associated with the serpent. This notion
is confirmed by the identification of Adonis and Osiris
as <i>Azar</i> or <i>Adar</i>, according to Bunsen the later Egyp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>tian
<i>Sar-Apis</i>, who is known to have been represented
as a serpent. The <i>Abaddon</i> of St. John, the old dragon
Satan, was probably intended for the same serpent-god.
It is interesting to compare the ideas entertained
as to the great dragon in the Book of Revelation and
those held by the Chinese in relation to probably the
same being. Mr. Doolittle says: “The dragon holds
a remarkable position in the history and government
of China. It also enjoys an ominous eminence in the
affections of the Chinese people. It is frequently represented
as the greatest benefactor of mankind. It
is the dragon which causes the clouds to form and the
rain to fall. The Chinese delight in praising its wonderful
properties and powers. It is the venerated
symbol of good.”</p>

<p>This was probably the view originally taken by the
Egyptians, who were all followers of the serpent cult.
In Egypt two kinds of serpents were the objects of
peculiar veneration, and of an almost universal worship.
All the gods were more or less symbolised or
crowned by serpents, while all the goddesses were
hieroglyphically represented by serpents. The animal
used for these purposes was the cobra de copello,
or uræus, which, according to Mr. W. R. Cooper,<a id="FNanchor_226_226" href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">226</a>
“from its dangerous beauty, and in consequence of
ancient tradition asserting it to have been spontaneously
produced by the rays of the sun,” was
universally assumed as the “emblem of divine and
sacro-regal sovereignty.” The uræus appears to be
always represented on the Egyptian monuments, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
the feminine form, and it was used as a symbol of
fecundity, agreeably to which idea the generative
power of the solar beams is typified by pendent uræi.
The uræus, moreover, symbolised life and the power
of healing, and it was the emblem of immortality.
Mr. Cooper remarks that in the Egyptian religious
system the principle of good was typically represented
by a serpent, while under the form of an entirely
different serpent was figured a monstrous <i>personal</i>
evil being who maintained a constant spiritual warfare
with the spirit of good. The serpent embodiment of
the principle of evil was called Hof, Rehof, or Aphôphis,
and it was a species of coluber of large size. It is
described as “the destroyer, the enemy of the gods,
and the devourer of the souls of men;” and it was
thought to dwell in the depths of “that mysterious
ocean upon which the Baris, or boat of the sun, was
navigated by the gods through the hours of day and
night, in the celestial regions.” The idea of an
antagonism between the giant serpent Aphôphis and
the good serpent, as the “soul of the world,” constantly
occurs in the Ritual of the Dead, and the aid
of every divinity in turn is sought by the deceased
in his conflict with the evil being. It is remarkable
that the “soul of the world,” Chnuphis, or Bait, is
represented as a coluber, and that it appears to be
identified with Aphôphis in one chapter of the Ritual.
Mr. Cooper states that, although a large coluber which
is figured as being worshipped resembles Aphôphis, it
cannot be him, as there is no example of direct worship
paid to Aphôphis,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span> “unless, indeed, we identify it
with Sutekh, as the Shepherd Kings, the last but one
of whom was named Aphôphis, appear to have done.”
The serpent Aphôphis is sometimes represented with
the crown of Lower Egypt upon his head, and at one
period he was identified with Set or Seth, the national
deity of the Hyksos or Shepherd tribes. All traces
of the worship of Set was obliterated from the Egyptian
monuments, but one representation has been preserved
in which Set is figured with Horus, united
as one divinity, between the triple serpent of good.
This shows that Set, and probably, therefore, his
serpent emblem, was originally not considered evil.
Lower Egypt was largely populated by Semitic peoples,
whose national deity was their legendary ancestor
Seth, and the detestation with which the Egyptians
regarded Set and the serpent Aphôphis identified with
him was probably the result of national enmity.
Mr. Cooper points out that the serpent of good is
always represented by the Egyptians as upright and
the serpent of evil as crawling, this being generally
the only distinction made. The god Chnuphis, the
“soul of the world,” is usually figured as a Serpent
(Coluber) walking upon two human legs, and curiously
enough this is the form taken by the evil principle of
Persian mythology, the great serpent walking on two
feet. A similar inversion of ideas occurs in the religious
mythology of the Naga peoples of the East. Near the
ruined temples of Cambodia, as on the Buddhist Topes
of India, are sculptured gigantic serpents with voluminous
folds supported by human figures, as the gigantic
Aphôphis is represented on the Egyptian monuments.
There must have been some special reason why the
great serpent was regarded so differently by various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
peoples, and this was probably the result of race
antagonism.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that one of the most ancient people
of whom we have any written record—the primitive
inhabitants of Chaldea—not only bore the name of
the traditional father of mankind, but were especially
identified with the serpent. The predecessors of the
<i>Akkad</i>, in Chaldea, were the Medes, or <i>Mad</i>, of
Berosus, and the distinctive title of at least the later
Medes was <i>Már</i>, which in Persian means “a snake.”
This Sir Henry Rawlinson supposes to have given rise
“not only to the Persian traditions of Zohák and his
snakes, but to the Armenian traditions, also, of the
dragon dynasty of Media.” The Medes of Berosus
belonged almost certainly to the old Scythic stock of
Central Asia, to whom the Chaldeans, the Hebrews,
and the Aryans have alike been affiliated by different
writers. When, therefore, Mr. Fergusson says that
serpent-worship characterised the old Turanian Chaldean
Empire, he would seem to trace it to the old
Asiatic centre. Probably to the same source must be
traced the serpent tradition of the Abyssinian kings.
Bryant long since asserted that that superstition originated
with the Amonians or Hamites, who also would
seem to have been derived from the Scythic stock.
The facts brought together in the preceding pages
far from exhaust the subject, but they appear to
justify the following conclusions:—</p>

<p>First, The serpent has been viewed with awe or
veneration from primeval times, and almost universally
as a re-embodiment of a deceased human
being, and as such there were ascribed to it the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
attributes of life and wisdom, and the power of
healing.</p>

<p>Secondly, The idea of a simple spirit re-incarnation
of a deceased ancestor gave rise to the notion that
mankind originally sprang from a serpent, and ultimately
to a legend embodying that idea.</p>

<p>Thirdly, This legend was connected with nature—or
rather sun-worship—and the sun was, therefore,
looked upon as the divine serpent-father of man and
nature.</p>

<p>Fourthly, Serpent-worship, as a developed religious
system, originated in Central Asia, the home of the
great Scythic stock, from whom all the civilised races
of the historical period sprang.</p>

<p>Fifthly, These peoples are the Adamites, and their
mythical ancestor was at one time regarded as the
Great Serpent, his descendants being in a special
sense serpent-worshippers.</p>

<small>THE ADAMITES.</small></h2>


<p>Much has from time to time been written as to
the distinction between the Adamites and the pre-Adamites,
although little has been done to identify
the members of the two great divisions into which the
human race has been thus divided. Those who accept
the Deluge of Noah as a historical fact, stated however
in terms too wide, may say generally that all the
descendants of this patriarch are, as such, Adamites,
while the pre-Adamites comprise the peoples of the
primitive area inhabited by the dark races, supposed
by some writers to be referred to in the Hebrew
Scriptures under the term <i>ish</i>, “the sons of man,” as
distinguished from the sons of Adam. Little value,
however, can be attached to such a general statement
as this. Supposing Noah to have been a second
common father of the race, we are still ignorant as to
what peoples are to be classed among his descendants.
No doubt the <i>Toldoth Beni Noah</i> of Genesis throws
considerable light on the question. According to
that genealogical table the whole earth was divided
after the Flood among the families of the three sons of
Noah—Shem, Ham, and Japheth. It is not necessary
here to identify the peoples described as the descendants
of these patriarchs. It will suffice to say that
Professor Rawlinson, who differs only in one or two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
particulars from other recent authorities, writes as to
the distribution of those peoples: “Whereas the
Japhetic and Hamitic races are geographically contiguous,
the former spread over all the northern
regions known to the genealogist—Greece, Thrace,
Scythia, most of Asia Minor, Armenia, and Media;
the latter over all the south and the south-west, North
Africa, Egypt, Nubia, Ethiopia, Southern and Southeastern
Arabia, and Babylonia—so the Semitic races
are located in what may be called one region, that
region being the central one, lying intermediate between
the Japhetic region upon the north and the
Hamitic one upon the south.”</p>

<p>Supposing the Toldoth to give an exact statement
of the descendants of the three sons of Noah, it by no
means follows that the peoples there referred to are
alone entitled to be classed as Adamites, and I propose,
therefore, to see whether the latter can be
identified by other evidence. Almost intuitively we
turn, in the first place, to that region known as
Chaldea, which has furnished in our own days
material so important for the reconstruction of the
annals of civilised man in the earliest historical period.
Professor Rawlinson, indeed, at the Liverpool meeting
of the British Association, held in 1870, sought to
establish that the Garden of Eden of the Hebrew
writers was none other than Babylonia; a hypothesis
which certainly agrees with Sir Henry Rawlinson’s
statement that <i>Héa</i>, the third member of the primitive
Chaldean triad, may be connected with the Paradisaical
traditions of the tree of knowledge and the
tree of life. This would point to Chaldea as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
original home of the Adamites, unless, indeed, the
traditions were derived from a still earlier centre, and
it will be well to ascertain whether there is anything
in the history of Babylon which directly connects
its people with the Adamic stock.</p>

<p>If we were to accept with Chwolson the great
antiquity of “The Book of Nabathæan Agriculture,”
there would be no difficulty in assigning such a position
to the Chaldeans. For this book not only
expressly declares that they were the descendants of
Adam, but in it Adam appears as the founder of
agriculture in Babylon, acting the part of a civiliser,
and hence named “The Father of Mankind.” This
agrees well with the Old Testament account of Adam
as the first cultivator of the ground. M. Renan, however,
would seem to have conclusively established the
late date of the so-called Nabathæan work, showing
that it contains legends as to Adam, Seth, Enoch,
Noah, and Abraham, “analogous to those which they
have in the apocryphal writings of the Jews and
Christians, and subsequently in those of the Mussulmans,”
Adam being known to all the Moslem East as
“The Father of Mankind.”</p>

<p>We must seek, therefore, for some more reliable
record of early Chaldean history; and this we have
in the stone monuments on which its annals were
engraved. Sir Henry Rawlinson, on their authority,
says of the Chaldeans of Babylonia that they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span> “a
branch of the great Hamitic race of <i>Akkad</i>, which
inhabited Babylonia from the earliest times. With
this race originated the art of writing, the building of
cities, the institution of a religious system, the cultivation
of all science, and of astronomy in particular.”
The race affinity of the <i>Akkad</i> is hardly yet settled,
but some information as to this point may be gained
from the name by which they were designated. This
appears to be composed of two words <i>Ak(k)-Ad</i>, the
latter of which may be identified with the first syllable
of the name Adam. As to the word <i>Ak</i>, some light
may probably be thrown on its meaning by reference
to the Celtic languages. Baldwin, without seeing its
full bearing, makes the remark that the Dravidians of
Southern India use <i>Mag</i>, as the Berbers and Gaels
use <i>Mac</i> (<i>Mach</i>), the former word denoting “kindred”
in all the Teutonic languages. Now, it could be
proved by many examples that the letter <i>M</i>, which is
found at the beginning of certain words in various
eastern languages, is often simply a prefix. This is
especially the case in Hebrew and Arabic, and, therefore,
probably in the more ancient languages with
which they are allied. Such, at least, must be the
case with the initial letter of the word <i>mach</i>, “son,” as
in Erse the <i>m</i> is wanting, and in Welsh the related
word, having the sense of “a root or stem, lineage,”
is also simply <i>ach</i>. Thus <i>Ak(k)-Ad</i> may well be
“the sons or lineage of Ad;” as Mac-Adam in Gaelic
is a son of Adam. That the first syllable of this
word had the signification here assigned to it is
rendered extremely probable by another circumstance.
It is well known that the Welsh equivalent for <i>Mach</i>,
in the sense of “son,” is <i>Ap</i>; and so also we find that
in Hebrew “son” is rendered by <i>ben</i> (the Assyrian
<i>ban</i>), while in Arabic it is <i>ibn</i>. In these words the <i>b</i>
is the root sound, and if son was expressed by <i>ak</i> in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
the old Akkad tongue, this would bear the same relation
to the Semitic languages as the Welsh does to the
Gaelic and Erse—<i>ak</i> and <i>ben</i> in the one class answering
to <i>ach</i> and <i>ap</i> in the other. Nor is this view without
positive support. The Hebrew has a word <i>ach</i> which
expresses, not only the sense of “a brother,” but also
“one of the same kindred.” In Assyrian <i>uk</i> means a
“people,” while <i>ak</i> signifies a “Creator;” these words
being connected with the old Egyptian <i>uk</i>, and also
<i>ahi</i>, “to live.”</p>

<p>Nor is the idea that the Chaldean <i>Akkad</i> were literally
“the sons of <i>Ad</i>” without historical basis. According
to Berosus, the first Babylonian dynasty was
Median. What people were referred to by this name
is still undecided. Professor Rawlinson supposes that
they were really the same as the so-called Aryan
Medes of later history, while Sir Henry Rawlinson,
although treating the later Medes as Aryan, yet considers
those of Bersosus to have belonged to a
Turanian, or at least a mixed Scytho-Aryan, stock.
Elsewhere Professor Rawlinson seems inclined to
identify the Chaldean <i>Akkad</i> with these Medes, as a
Turanian people who at a very early date conquered
the Babylonian Kushites and mixed with them. This
is, in fact, the conclusion which appears to be required
by other considerations. The name by which the
Medes are first noticed on the Assyrian monuments is
<i>Mad</i>. But if the initial labial is removed, this name
is reduced to the more simple form <i>Ad</i>; and, supposing
the explanation given of the primitive name of the
Chaldean race to be correct, the <i>(M)ad</i> who preceded
them would really be the parent stock from which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
<i>Akkad</i>, or Chaldeans, were derived. Confirmation of
this notion may be supplied from another source.
Among their Aryan neighbours the later Medes had
the distinctive title of <i>Már</i>. This, Sir Henry Rawlinson
supposes to have given rise, “not only to the
Persian traditions of Zohák and his snakes, but to the
Armenian traditions also of the dragon dynasty of
Media, the word <i>Már</i> having in Persian the signification
of a snake.” But this must have been through
ignorance of the real origin of the title, which had reference
rather to the lion than to the snake. The
Arab historian, Massoudi, in accounting for the application
to the city of Babylon of the name of <i>Iran-Sheher</i>,
observes that, “according to some, the true
orthography should be <i>Arian-Sheher</i>,” which signifies
in Nabathæan, “the city of Lions,” and that “this
name of Lion designated the kings of Assyria, who
bore the general title of Nimrud.” Sir Henry Rawlinson
thinks that the title <i>Már</i> is Scythic, and, if so,
there can be little doubt of its signification. The primitive
meaning of <i>Ar</i> was “fire,” from which the lion,
as the symbol of the Sun-god was called <i>ari</i>, the Sun-god
himself having a name <i>Ra</i>. Strictly, therefore,
<i>Már</i> would denote “fire-worshippers,” a title which,
as is well-known, was especially applicable to the
ancient Medes. The <i>Aryans</i> generally appear to have
been Sun-or Fire-worshippers, and probably they
received their name from this fact. This would seem
to be much more probable than the ordinary derivation
of the name Aryan from the root <i>ar</i>, “to
plough;” and it would include the sense of “noble”
preferred by Mr. Peile,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span> “children of the Sun”
being usually a special title of the priestly or royal
caste.</p>

<p>Connected with this question is that of the origin of
the name of the Greek god <i>Ares</i> (the Latin <i>Mars</i>).
Among other grounds for inferring the Asiatic origin
of this deity is his connection with Herakles. The
Latin myth of Hercules and Cacus would seem, moreover,
to require the identification of the former with
Mars. Such would appear to be the case also in Chaldean
mythology. The Babylonian Mars was called
<i>Nergal</i>, which is probably the same name as “Hercules,”
and Sir Henry Rawlinson suggests that the
only distinction to be made between that deity and
<i>Nin</i>, or Hercules, as gods of war and hunting, is that
the former is more addicted to the chase of animals
and the latter to that of mankind. That Hercules, or
Herakles, was of Phœnician or Assyrian origin has been
fully established by the learned researches of M. Raoul-Rochette,
who has shown, moreover, that the proper
name of that deity was <i>Sandan</i> or <i>Adanos</i> (<i>Adan</i>), a
name which not only reminds us of Aduni, supposed
by Professor Rawlinson to be a primeval Chaldean
deity, but also recalls that of the Median <i>Ad</i>, and even
of the Hebrew <i>Adam</i>.</p>

<p>A remark made by Lajard strongly confirms the idea
that the Latin war-god was derived from a similar
source. This learned French writer accounts for the
rapidity with which <i>Mazdëism</i>, better known as the
worship of Mithra, spread among the Romans, by supposing
that it was in some way connected with their
national worship. Probably a key to this connection
may be found in the curious figures of Mithra which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
appear to have been peculiar to the Roman phase of
Mazdëism. These figures, which are encircled by a
serpent, unite to the human body and limbs, the head
of the lion, and they might well be taken to represent
Mars himself, since the title <i>Már</i>, which was distinctive
of the Medes, not only conveyed the idea of a serpent,
but was also, and more intimately, associated with the
lion symbol of the Sun-god.</p>

<p>If the alliance thus sought to be established, through
the title <i>Már</i>, between the Medes or <i>Mad</i>, and the
other peoples of the so-called Aryan stock be correct,
we may expect to find traces among some, at least, of
these peoples of the primeval <i>Ad</i>. Nor will such expectation
be disappointed. The Parsis of Bombay
have a book called the “Desatir,” the first part of
which is entitled “the Book of the Great <i>Abad</i>,” who
is declared to have been the first ancestor of mankind.
The authenticity of this book has been denied, as Mr.
Baldwin thinks, however, on insufficient grounds. It
is certainly strange, on the assumption of its being
apocryphal, that such a name as <i>Abad</i> should have
been given to the mythical head of the race. The
meaning of the name is evidently “Father <i>Ad</i>” and
there is nothing improbable in the Persians preserving
a tradition of the mythical ancestor, whose memory was
retained in the national name of the Medes, a people
with whom they were so closely connected. It simply
confirms the conclusion before arrived at, that they
also must be classed among the Adamites.</p>

<p>The Hindus themselves would seem not to be without
a remembrance of the mythical ancestor of the
Adamic stock. The Puranas, which, notwithstanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
their modern form, doubtless retain many old legends,
refers to the reign of King <i>It</i> or <i>Ait</i>, as an avatar of
Mahadeva (<i>Siva</i>), who is a form of Saturn. Assuming
that the information given to Wilford as to the reign
of this king in Egypt ought to be rejected; yet, as
<i>Aetus</i> is mentioned by Greek writers as a Hindu, we
must suppose such information to have been founded
on actual statements contained in the Puranas. These
certainly refer to the <i>Yáduvas</i>, descendants of Yadu,
supposed emigrants to Abyssinia, whose character, as
described in the Puranas, agrees well, says Wilford,
with that ascribed “by the ancients to the genuine
Ethiopians, who are said by Stephanus of Byzantium,
by Eusebius, by Philostratus, by Eustathius, and others,
to have come originally from India under the guidance
of Aetus or Yátu,” whom they believed to be the
same as King Ait.</p>

<p>Nor do the Celtic peoples appear to be without a
traditional remembrance of the mythical ancestor.
The leading Celtic people of Gaul, in the time of
Cæsar, were the <i>Ædin</i>, and Davies thought that their
name was derived from <i>Aedd</i> the Great, whom he
finds referred to in the Welsh triads, and whom he
identifies with <i>Aides</i> or <i>Dis</i>. Cæsar, indeed, says that
the god <i>Dis</i> was the mythical ancestor of the Gauls.
The position occupied by this deity in the traditions
of the Celtic race is very remarkable, when we consider
that a divine person bearing the same name
was known, not only to the Greeks, but apparently
also to the Babylonians. Sir Henry Rawlinson points
out that <i>Dis</i> should be one of the names of <i>Anu</i>, the
first member of the leading Chaldean triad, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
deity who answered to <i>Hades</i> or <i>Pluto</i>. <i>Warka</i> or
<i>Urka</i>, the great necropolis of Babylon, was especially
dedicated to <i>Anu</i>, and Sir Henry Rawlinson remarks on
this: “Can the coincidence then be merely accidental
between <i>Dis</i>, the Lord of <i>Urka</i>, the City of the Dead,
and <i>Dis</i>, the King of Orcus or Hades?” Most certainly
not, as it is only one of many circumstances
which prove the close connection of the Greeks and
other Aryan peoples with the ancient Babylonians.
The original character of <i>Dis</i>, “Lord of the Dead,”
was probably the same as that of the Gallic <i>Dis</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
the mythical ancestor of the race. A similar change
of character has been undergone by the Hindu <i>Yama</i>.</p>

<p>It is very probable that in the divine ancestor
<i>Dis</i>, as in the mythical King <i>It</i> of the Hindus, we
have reference to the primeval <i>Ad</i>.<a id="FNanchor_227_227" href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> A common relationship
as Adamites may be shown, as well by association
with the Medes, through their title <i>Már</i>, as by
preservation of a tradition of the common ancestor.</p>

<p>The result, so far, is that not only the Persians,
Greeks, and Romans, and probably the Hindus, but
also the Celtic peoples, have been connected with the
Medes or <i>Mad</i>, and through them with the <i>Akkad</i>.
But among the peoples supposed to be still more
nearly allied to the Chaldeans, we may expect to
find references to the mythical ancestor of the Adamic
division of mankind. According to old tradition,
indeed, <i>Ad</i> himself was the primeval father of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
original Arab stock. Moreover, the dialect of Mahrah,
where pure Arab blood is supposed still to exist, is
called the language of <i>Ad</i>. It can hardly be doubted
that a reference to the same mythical personage is
also contained in the name of the great deity of the
Syrians, <i>Adad</i>, “King of Kings,” whose title implies
the idea of “fatherhood.” Nor are there wanting
traces of the primeval <i>Ad</i> among the Egyptians.
Mr. William Osburn states that the name of the
local god of On or Heliopolis “is written on the
monuments with the characters representing the
sound <i>a, t, m</i>.” This God was associated with the
setting sun, and he was placed with the gods of the
other cities of the Delta, a distinction he received,
says Osburn, “for the triple reason, that he was the
local god of the capital city, that he was the father of
mankind, and that he was the ruler and guide of the
sun, the common dispenser of earthly blessings to all
men.” <i>Atum</i> thus becomes identified with the Hebrew
<i>Adam</i>, and although the description given by Osburn
of the Egyptian deity may require some qualification,
yet that identification is strengthened rather than
weakened by other considerations. Bunsen says that
the office of <i>Atum</i> in the lower world is that of a
judge, and he supposes from this that at one time he
may have been a Dispater. He does, indeed, bear
much the same relation to man as <i>Dis</i> himself. In the
Ritual of the Dead, the souls call him father, and he
addresses them as children. Sir Gardner Wilkinson
says that <i>Atum</i>, or <i>Atmoo</i>, is always figured with a
human head and painted of a red colour. This seems
to confirm the idea derived from his name, that this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
deity was related to the Hebrew Adam, with whom
the idea of <i>ruddiness</i> was undoubtedly associated. The
human form of the Egyptian Atum shows, moreover,
that he was considered as peculiarly connected
with man.</p>

<p>It has now been shown that not only are the people
mentioned in the <i>Toldoth Beni Noah</i> rightly classed as
descendants of the mythical <i>Ad</i>, but that the Asiatic
Aryans, with the allied peoples of Europe to the furthest
limits of the Celtic area, may also well be thus
described. The ancient <i>Mad</i> belonged, however, to
the great Scythic stock, and hence all the Turanian
peoples, including the Chinese, may doubtless be
classed among the Adamites. There is some ground,
therefore, for asserting that the Adamites include all
the so-called Turanian and Aryan peoples of Asia and
Europe, with the Hamitic and Semitic peoples of
Western Asia and Northern Africa—in fact, the yellow,
the red, and the white races, as distinguished from the
darker peoples of the tropics. But even these
limits may perhaps be extended. One of the solar
heroes of the Volsung Tale is <i>Atli</i>, who becomes the
second husband of Gudrun, the widow of Sigurd,
Sigurd himself being the slayer of the dragon Fafnir,
who symbolises the darkness or cold of a northern
winter—the Vritra of Hindu mythology. This dragon
enemy of Indra was also called <i>Ahi</i>, the strangling
snake, who appears again as <i>Atri</i>, and Mr. Cox supposes
that the name <i>Atri</i> may be the same as the
<i>Atli</i> of the Volsung Tale. <i>Atli</i>, who in the Nibelung
song is called <i>Etzel</i>, overpowers the chieftains of
Niflheim, who refused to give up the golden treasures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
which Sigurd had won from the dragon, and he
throws them into a pit full of snakes.</p>

<p>The connection of the Teutonic hero with the serpent
is remarkable; for in the Mexican mythology we meet
with a divinity having almost the same name, and
associated with the same animal. Humboldt tells us
that the Great Spirit of the Toltecks was called <i>Teotl</i>;
and Hardwicke says that <i>Teotl</i> was the only God of
Central America. If so, however, he was a serpent
deity, for the temples of Yucatan were undoubtedly
dedicated to a deity of that nature. It is not improbable,
however, that <i>Teotl</i> was really a generic term,
agreeing in this respect, as curiously enough in its
form, with the Phœnician <i>Taaut</i> (<i>Thoth</i>).</p>

<p>The God to whom the temples of Yucatan were
really dedicated appears to be <i>Quetzalcoatl</i>, by some
writers called the feathered serpent, a title belonging
rather to his serpent-father <i>Tonacatlcoatl</i>. This
<i>Quetzalcoatl</i> was the mysterious stranger who, according
to tradition, founded the civilisation of Mexico,
agreeing thus in his character of a god of wisdom with
the Egyptian <i>Thoth</i>; reminding us of the resemblance
of the name of this deity to that of the Toltecan <i>Teotl</i>.
But the first part of the name of the Mexican <i>Quetzalcoatl</i>
no less resembles that borne by the Teutonic
deity, <i>Etzel</i>. <i>Co-atl</i> signifies the “serpent,” while
<i>quetzal</i> would seem to have reference to the male
principle; and thus the idea expressed in the name of
the Mexican god is the male principle represented as
a serpent. <i>Quetzalcoatl</i>, moreover, is said to be an
incarnation of <i>Tonacatlcoatl</i>, who is the male-serpent,
his wife being called <i>Cihua-coatl</i>, meaning, literally,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
the “woman of the serpent,” or “female serpent.” In
the identification, then, of <i>Atli</i> or <i>Etzel</i>, who consigns
his enemies to the pit of serpents, with the great
serpent <i>Ahi</i> himself, we have a ground of identification
of the Teutonic deity with the Mexican serpent-god
<i>Quetzalcoatl</i>. This view loses none of its probability
if the latter is, as Mr. Squire asserts, an incarnation
of the serpent-sun, or rather a serpent incarnation
of the sun-god, since <i>Ahi</i> himself is a solar deity.
In the religious symbols used by the Mexicans, we
have another point of contact with the Asiatic deities.
The sacred <i>Tau</i> of antiquity has its counterpart on the
Mexican monuments. The Mexican symbol perfectly
represents the cross form of the <i>Tau</i>, but it is composed
of two serpents entwined, somewhat as in the
caduceus of Mercury. That the <i>Tau</i> itself had such
an origin we can well believe, seeing that the name of
the letter <i>Tet</i> (θετα) of the Phœnician alphabet specially
associated with <i>Thoth</i>, of whom the <i>Tau</i> is a symbol,
is that of the God himself, as well as meaning
“serpent.”</p>

<p>If the comparison thus made between the Mexican
and Teutonic mythologies is correct, the further
analogies pointed out by M. Brasseur de Bourbourg
may be well founded. Thus the Mexican <i>Votan</i> or
<i>Odon</i>, supposed to be the same as <i>Quetzalcoatl</i>, may
be in reality none other than the Scandinavian <i>Odin</i>,
<i>Woden</i>, or <i>Wuotan</i>, who, if not a sun-god, was the
sky-god, whose eye was the sun (Grimm’s “Teutonic
Mythology,” translated by Stallybrass, p. 703). The
snake is intimately associated with Odin in Norse
mythology (Grimm, p. 685) as it is with Votan, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
both these personages have been identified with the
Indian Buddha god.<a id="FNanchor_228_228" href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">228</a></p>

<p>Nor is there wanting confirmative evidence of such
an affinity between the peoples of the Old and the New
Worlds as that supposed. Mr. Tylor, in his work on
“Primitive Culture,” points out that the Roman game
of <i>bucca-bucca</i>, referred to in a passage of Petronius,
is still retained as the old nursery game, “Buck,
buck, how many horns do I hold up?” The
meaning of this formula is not given, but, from the
fact that the witch’s devil of the middle ages was
represented as a buck or goat, we can hardly doubt
that the buck or bucca of the game referred to the
evil spirit. The devil was, indeed, called by the
Cornish Celts <i>bucka</i> (Welsh <i>bwg</i>), a hobgoblin, a name
which is evidently connected with the Russian <i>buka</i>, a
sprite, and with the <i>Bog</i> of Slavonic and other allied
languages. We have, no doubt, the same word in
the name of the Finnic sky-god <i>Ukko</i>. Of this again
we seem to have traces, not only in the Kalmuck
<i>Búrkhan</i> and the Mantchoo <i>Ab-ka</i>, but also in the
Hottentot <i>Teqoa</i> (Kafir, <i>Tixo</i>), the Supreme God;
and in the word <i>yakko</i>, demon, the name given to the
aborigines of Ceylon by their Hindu conquerors. But
the root of this word is met with again among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
American tribes. The Hurons believe the sky to be
an <i>oki</i>, or demon, this name being also that by which
the natives of Virginia knew their chief god. The
same word appears to enter into the name of the
Algonquin god of the North Wind, <i>Kabibon-okka</i>, as
also of the Muyscan Moon goddess, <i>Huyth-aca</i>.
Whether the Algonquin Great Spirit, <i>Kitchi-Manitu</i>,
has preserved the same word, is questionable; but it
is noticeable that in the mythology of Kamtschatka
the first man is called <i>Haetsh</i>, and he is the son of
<i>Kutka</i>, the Creator, whose name, by the allowable
change of <i>t</i> for <i>k</i>, becomes almost the same as the
Finnic <i>Ukko</i>. The word <i>oki</i> may, moreover, be found,
with merely the vowel change, among the Islanders of
the Pacific. Thus the Polynesian fire-god is <i>Mahu-ika</i>,
the last syllable of which is doubtless connected with
<i>akua</i>, meaning, like the American <i>oki</i>, spirit, or demon.
The same root is met with again in <i>Tiki</i>, the Rarotongan
form of <i>Maui</i>, the divine ancestor of the New
Zealanders, and the <i>Tii</i> of the Society Islands; also in
<i>Akea</i>, the name of the mythical first king of Hawaii.
<i>Tiki</i> is probably only another form of <i>Ta-ata</i>, with
the change of <i>k</i> for <i>t</i> (as in <i>akua</i> for <i>atua</i>); and it is
remarkable that this name of the Polynesian First Man
is really that of the mythical ancestor of the Adamites,
reversed, however, and with the addition of the word
<i>ata</i> (<i>aka</i>), spirit, which we have shown to be connected
with the name for God among so many independent
races. Mr. Fornander identifies the Polynesian word
<i>aitu</i> or <i>iku</i>, spirit, with the name of the great “Kushite”
king It or Ait, and he states that the idea of royalty or
sovereignty attached to that word is observed in old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
Hawaiian tradition.—“The Polynesian Race,” 1878,
vol. i., pp. 44, 54.</p>

<p>These mythological coincidences are, indeed, so
strongly supported by similarity of customs and linguistic
affinities, that there can be no difficulty in
classing the Mexicans and kindred American peoples,
and even the lighter Polynesians, with the Adamites.
This being so, a still broader generalisation than any
yet attempted may be made as to the peoples to be
included in the Adamic division of the human race.
The simplest classification of mankind, according to
cranial conformation, is that of Retzius into dolichocephali,
or long heads, and brachycephali, or short
heads. The Mexicans, and other peoples of the
western part of the American Continent, belong to
the latter category, as do also the inhabitants of the
greater part of the area of Asia and Europe. In
China, and in the southern part of Asia as well as of
Europe, the various peoples are chiefly long-headed,
and this is the case with the Hamitic population of
Northern Africa. The latter are, however, certainly
much mixed with the native African element, which
is purely dolichocephalic, exhibiting traces of its
prognathism; and it is far from improbable that
originally they were brachycephalic, like the allied
peoples of Western Asia. Such also may have been
the case with the Chinese and the lighter Polynesians,
who are now nearly dolichocephalic.<a id="FNanchor_229_229" href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> Throughout all
the regions where these peoples are found there would
appear to have been an indigenous long-headed stock,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
which has more or less nearly absorbed the brachycephalic
element, which was introduced long ages ago
from the vast regions of Central Asia, and which, for
want of a better term, may be called Scythic. Subject to
this qualification, it may probably be said that Adamic
and short-headed are synonymous terms, and that
among the descendants of Father <i>Ad</i> may, therefore,
be classed all the peoples who are embraced in the
great brachycephalic division of mankind, or who
would have belonged to it, if they had not been physically
modified by contact with peoples of the more
primitive dolichocephalic area.</p>

<p>How far the Adamites have trespassed on this area
it is difficult to determine. That they have become
mixed with the peoples of the African Continent to a
much larger extent than is usually supposed may be
believed. The Hottentots, at its extremest limit, are
no doubt a residual deposit of such intermixture;
while the great family to which the Kafirs belong
furnish evidence of it in various particulars. The
Adamites appear also to have spread throughout the
archipelagos of the Pacific, furnishing an explanation
of the many customs and myths in which the Polynesian
Islanders agree with Asiatic peoples. Nor are
the Adamites much less widely spread throughout the
American Continent. Apart from what Professor Busk
affirms, that a broad type of head is to be met with
on the coast all round South America, peoples allied
to those of Mexico and Central America would seem
to have occupied many of the West Indian Islands,
and to have penetrated through the central portion of
North America to the Great Lakes. Wherever the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
Adamites have come into contact with the long-headed
pre-Adamitic stock, they have either made
these to disappear, or, while having their physical
structure somewhat modified by intermixture, they
have established a supremacy due to their greater
vigour and mental energy. It is difficult, indeed, to
say where the descendants of <i>Ad</i> are not now to be
met with, or where the pre-Adamite is to be found uninfluenced
by contact with them.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it will be well to endeavour to
ascertain the origin of the tradition as to <i>Adam</i> or
father <i>Ad</i>. According to usually received teaching,
Adam and Eve were the actual first parents of the
human race, or, at all events, of the Adamic portion
of it. Whether or not this idea is correct need not be
further considered here, beyond stating that if, as
Bunsen suggests, the existence of other antediluvian
patriarchs be mythical, so also must be that of Adam
from whom they are said to have sprung.</p>

<p>The Semitic word ADaM conveys several ideas. In
the form <i>Adamah</i> or <i>Adami</i> it has reference to the
<i>earth</i> or <i>soil</i>, but its primary sense was either “red”
or “man.” Probably a double meaning was conveyed
in the name of the Egyptian god Atum, whose
representation was that of a red man. It must be
noted, however, that the traditional ancestor is usually
styled, not <i>Adam</i> but simply <i>Ad</i>; and this primitive
root may have had some other signification, analogous
perhaps to that of <i>Eve</i> (<i>Hhavváh</i>), “the mother of all
living.” This word, which denotes “life,” is from
<i>hhayáh</i>, to live, to give life—the allied word in Arabic
being <i>haywān</i>, and the Arabic name for Eve becoming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
<i>hawwa</i>. Now, in the Celtic dialects <i>ad</i> forms the root
of words denoting vegetable vitality. In Welsh, moreover,
<i>tad</i> is a father; the base, <i>ta</i>, denoting, among
allied senses, “a supreme one,” reminding us of the
Chinese <i>ta</i>, great; and connected with it being <i>tras</i>,
kindred, affinity. Turning, however, to Eastern languages,
we find that the old Egyptian had a word <i>ti</i>, with
a sense analogous to that of the Welsh <i>ta</i>, and also a verb
<i>ta</i>, to give, which is found in Hebrew, as <i>’athah</i>, to come,
and in Arabic as <i>ata</i>, to give, or to bring forth. It is
evident that the primitive root, consisting of the
dental <i>t</i> or <i>d</i>, preceded or followed by a vowel sound,
had associated with it the idea of activity, and probably
of paternity. In the old Akkad speech, indeed,
<i>ad</i> itself signifies a “father,” and we are justified,
therefore, in supposing that when this word was used
as the name of the mythical common ancestor, it had
a sense analogous to that which “Eve” expressed,
<i>i.e.</i>, “the <i>father</i> of life, or of all living.” In Adam and
Eve, therefore, we may have a reference to the male
and female principles which, in the philosophy of the
ancients, as in that of the Chinese and some other
Eastern peoples, pervade all nature, and originate all
things, applied particularly, however, to the human
race. But Adam was not the name given at first to
this mystical father of the race. The Egyptian <i>Atum</i>
was originally a cosmogonic deity. Bunsen states that
the name of this god may be resolved into <i>At-Mu</i>,
meaning “Creator of the mother or night.” The
sense of this, however, is not very apparent, and it may
be suggested that the term <i>Adam</i> (in Egyptian <i>Atum</i>)
was formed by the combination of the primitive <i>akkad</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
words <i>Ad</i>, father, and <i>Dam</i>, mother. It would thus
originally express a dual idea, agreeably to the statement
in Gen. v. 2, that male and female were called
“Adam.” This agrees perfectly with the Persian
tradition which made the first human being androgynous.
When the dual idea expressed in the name
was forgotten, Adam became the Great Father, the
Great Mother receiving the name of Eve (Hhavváh),
<i>i.e.</i>, living or life, although <i>Adam</i> in the generic sense
of “Mankind,” denoted both male and female.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Note.</i>—The Turanian or rather Altaic affinity of
the Akkad, referred to at page 109 above, appears to
have been established by M. Lenormant, who states
that their name means “Mountaineers,” from <i>Akkad</i>, a
mountain. It is possible, however, that the word
may have had a more primitive signification. As the
name of a country and not of a people, Akkad did
not come into use until the Assyrian epoch, “When
the Accadian had become a dead language, and the tradition
of the real meaning of the word was consequently
quite lost.” (<i>Chaldean Magic and Sorcery</i>, p. 404.)
As to the aboriginal Arab people referred to at page
117, it may be mentioned that M. Lenormant (<i>Hist.
Anc. de l’Orient</i>, 9th Ed. I. t. prem. p. 313), points
out that the name, Adah, of the mother of the two
sons of Lameckh, who were chiefs of pastoral races, is
only the feminine form of that of the people of Ad.</p>

<small>THE DESCENDANTS OF CAIN.</small></h2>


<p>In various parts not only of the old world continents,
but also of America, and even on some of the Islands
of the Pacific, are the ruins of stone buildings which,
from their general character, are well called “Kyklopean.”
The style of architecture varies in different
countries according to the uses for which the buildings
were designed, or the local influences among which
they were erected. Whatever their form, all those
ancient buildings agree in the massive character of their
structure, and most of them in the fact that the stones
are put together without mortar or cement. Kyklopean
architecture proper (in which large unhewn blocks
are rudely put together with small stones to fill up
the interstices) differs, however, from the <i>Polygonal</i> or
<i>Pelasgian</i>, and from the <i>Horizontal</i> or <i>Etruscan</i>, which,
in addition, has the courses scrupulously level, with
joints vertical, and fitting accurately. General Forlong,
the author of “Rivers of Life, or Faiths of Man in all
Ages,” while pointing out that distinction, remarks
that those several styles do not denote different ages,
and that the builders were evidently of the same race.
This opinion is confirmed by the fact that all the three
styles are found in the ruins of Peru, whose Kyklopean
structures, moreover, are not restricted to those of rectangular
formation, but sometimes take the form of
round towers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span></p>

<p>General Forlong identifies the great building race of
antiquity with the Kushites or Aithiopians of the Greek
historians, and with Mr. Fergusson, he supposes them
to have belonged to the Turanian family of peoples.
The distinguished architect and archæologist affirms,
indeed, that not only were the Turanians the great
architects and builders of remote antiquity, but that
they were the inventors of all the arts, as well as the
religions and mythologies, which were afterwards
developed by the later Shemites and Aryans.</p>

<p>But how far does this conclusion agree with actual
facts? M. Georges Perrot, in his important work on
the “History of Art,” says that the ancient Oriental
world has seen the birth of three great civilisations,
that of Egypt, that of Chaldea, and that of China, all
of which have features in common, although each
preserves its own proper character. Chaldea was the
<i>Sennaar</i> of the author of the Book of Genesis, the land
in which were built the ancient cities of Babel, Erech,
Accad, and Calneh. The mighty hunter or warrior
Nimrod, to whom the erection of those cities is ascribed,
was the son of Kush and the grandson of Cham,
and he is thus placed by the sacred writer in the same
family as the Egyptians, Aithiopians, and the Libyans,
as also the Canaanites and Phœnicians. The Kushites,
of whom Nimrod is the representative in Genesis, were
located by the poets and classical historians in Susiana
rather than in Chaldea. Both of these countries, however,
adjoin the Valley of the Tigris, and the name
Aithiopians applied by those writers to the inhabitants
of the shores of the Persian Gulf and the sea of Oman
agrees with the relationship which, according to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
genealogists of the Hebrew Scriptures, subsisted between
the Kushites of Asia and those of Africa. It is
to the shores of the Persian Gulf that the development,
if not the origin, of the Chaldean civilisation has been
traced. M. Perrot calls Egypt “the ancestor of civilised
nations,” and he affirms that, in grouping the
great peoples of antiquity to determine the part taken
by each in the work of progress, it is necessary to
commence with Egypt as the point of departure of all
the forces which operate to that end. The Egyptians
were not, however, indigenous to the Valley of the
Nile. It is now almost universally acknowledged that
they belonged to the white or Caucasian stock of
Europe and Western Asia, from which they reached
Egypt by the isthmus of Suez. Their Caucasian origin
is confirmed by their language, which, with the other
Hamitic idioms, had, as M. Lenormant shows, a relationship
to the Semitic languages, the two families
having a common mother language, the native country
of which was in Asia at the east of the basin of the
Euphrates and Tigris. We are thus taken to the
region where the old Chaldean civilisation flourished
for the place of origin of the Egyptians; but did they
belong to the same Kushite stock? In endeavouring
to answer this question, it is necessary to remember
that before the foundation of the Empire by Menes
Egypt had comprised two kingdoms, that of Lower
Egypt or the country of the north, and that of Upper
Egypt or the country of the south. These kingdoms
must have existed a considerable period, judging from
the fact that the later Monarchs carried two crowns
to indicate the dominion exercised over the two great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
divisions of the Empire, and probably it represented
some race difference in their inhabitants. The Aryan
character described by M. L. Page Renouf to the
Egyptian mythology, and the features of many of the
figures represented on the tombs of the fourth Dynasty,
might lead us to suppose that the earliest Egyptians
belonged to the Aryan stock. This opinion is, perhaps,
confirmed by the consideration that the earliest and
most sacred towns of the Egyptians were situate in
Upper Egypt.</p>

<p>M. Lenormant thinks that the descendants of
Mizraim settled in Egypt at different epochs, and that
the earliest settlers, the Anamim of the Old Testament
and the Anou of the hieroglyphic inscriptions, were
driven by the later ones into different parts of Egypt,
but principally into Nubia. The former may, therefore,
have been pure Aryans, the southern country being
referred to as the home of the race; although the
Empire was first established in Lower Egypt, its chief
centre being Memphis, from which its culture gradually
overspread the whole country. The early inhabitants
of the Delta region were represented at a later date
by the Hyksos, who have been identified by Professor
Duncker with the Philistines of the Syrian Coast.
This people are spoken of in the Book of Genesis as
descendants of Mizraim, and their neighbours, the
Phœnicians, stood in the same relation to the northern
Egyptians as did the Kushites of Chaldea. Like the
latter peoples, the Phœnicians were great builders.
The remains of vast structures still exist throughout
Phœnicia, which was known to the ancient Babylonians
as Martu, “the west.” Among modern writers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
M. Renan is of opinion that “singular relations exist
between the ethnographic, historic, and linguistic
position of Yemen and that of Phœnicia,” as showing
that there was a close relationship between the latter
and the ancient people of Southern Arabia. Mr.
Baldwin accepts both these views, and comes to the
conclusion that the first great civilisers and builders
of antiquity were the Kushites or Aithiopians of
Southern Arabia, and that they colonised or civilised
Chaldea, Phœnicia, and Egypt. Tradition speaks of
Kepheus as one of the great sovereigns of ancient
Aithiopia, whose kingdom extended from the Mediterranean
to the Persian Gulf, and whose capital was
Joppa, one of the most ancient cities of Phœnicia.
We may well believe that this very early Kushite
kingdom comprised part of Northern Africa, and
therefore that it included the Delta of the Nile with
the great city, Memphis, of the Egyptian pyramid
builders. The similarity in many features of the
Phœnician and Egyptian architecture points to a close
connection between those peoples, and a portion of
the Kushite race which peopled Phœnicia doubtless
settled in the Delta, from whence its culture would
easily spread throughout the Nile Valley. It is certain
that Southern Arabia was the seat of a very primitive
civilisation, which influenced all the regions around.
Phœnicia, however, would seem to have been most
intimately allied with Chaldea, the origin of whose
civilisation, although ascribed to the fish-god Oannes,
can hardly be traced to Arabia.</p>

<p>According to the Biblical writer, Kush was the eldest
son of Ham, who was also the father of Mizraim, Phut,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
and Canaan. All these peoples were great builders,
and it is very probable, therefore, that they, as well as
the Kushites, derived their knowledge from a common
source. In this case, and even if Mizraim, Canaan,
and Phut were the <i>descendants</i> rather than the brethren
of Kush, the civilisation with which the Kushites are
accredited was, in reality, that of the earlier Hamites.
The probability is that all the peoples belonging to
the Hamitic stock possessed the elements of a very
ancient civilisation, which was handed down in the
most direct line through the Kushites of Chaldea.
M. Perrot accepts the opinion of M. Oppert, that
when the primitive Chaldeans first settled in the
plains of Sennaar they already had a national organisation,
and that they possessed writing, the most
necessary industries, a religion, and a complete legislation.
If this was so we shall have to seek a very
primitive source for the Kushite or Hamitic civilisation.
What was its origin can only be ascertained when the
race ancestry of the Hamites is known. In relation
to this point it must not be forgotten that Ham was the
brother of Shem and Japhet, and therefore that they
were all members of a common family. As the descendants
of Noah, they all alike belonged to the
great white or Caucasian stock. M. Lenormant, while
endorsing this view, says that anciently, as in the
present day, there was an anthropological distinction
between the Hamites and the Shemites, which he
accounts for by supposing the former to have become
intermixed with a dark or black race, which they
found already established in the country to which
they spread, while the Shemites, who stayed behind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
preserved the purity of the white race. The facts of
linguistic science and anthropology can thus be made
to agree, but M. Lenormant has to admit that the
Eastern Kushites cannot be brought within that
theory, as from the earliest historical period they have
spoken a language radically distinct from those of the
Shemites and the other Hamitic peoples. He adds
that the coast between the Persian Gulf and the Indus
appears to have been, from a remote antiquity, the
point of meeting and fusion of two distinct races
having brown complexions, but inclining more or less
to pure black. The Eastern Kushites are thus confounded
by a gradual series of transitions with the
Dravidians of India. This reference to the Dravidians
is perfectly just, as there is no doubt, whatever
may be the case now, that originally they partook
of the high qualities possessed by the peoples of the
Kushite stock. As a race they were noted for their
love of art and commerce, and General Forlong, after
having examined minutely most of the famous shrines
of India, came to the conclusion “that there is nothing
to equal those of Dravidia, save some small ones in
Western India, which, in their completeness, form,
and conception, denote the same master builders who,
as Jainas, &amp;c., learned in Mysore and the South under
those great architects.” There is indeed reason to
believe that the marvellous temples of Cambodia and
Java, of which the ruins still exist, were erected by
Dravidians from India. M. Moura, the learned author
of a history of Cambodia, has established that the
great architects of that kingdom were the peoples to
whom the name of Khmerdoms is given by their de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>scendants,
the Khmers. They were of Hindoo origin,
and emigrated from the neighbourhood of Delhi in
the fifth century before Christ. Whether the original
Khmers were of pure Aryan stock is, however, very
doubtful, and it is extremely probable that they
were Hinduised Dravidians. The Hindoos, to whom
the civilisation of Java is ascribed, are spoken of as
coming from Kling, by which is meant the Dravidian
Telinga.</p>

<p>If, as M. Lenormant supposes, the Eastern Kushites
became fused with a brown or black race, it does not
follow that this race was originally black, or that it
belonged to a negroid stock. All the Hamites, and
especially the Kushites, were of a more or less dark
complexion, but the black hue may have been acquired
through natural influences operating during a vast
period of time. The Dravidians have, at least from a
linguistic standpoint, Turanian affinities, and it is now
almost universally admitted that the earliest civilised
inhabitants of Chaldea belonged to the great Turanian
family of peoples who are usually spoken of as the
yellow race. There is no doubt that a yellow race,
whose languages had an affinity on the one side with
the languages of the Altaic peoples, and on the other
side with the Dravidian dialects, and who preceded
the Shemitic and Japhetic peoples in material civilisation,
existed in Eastern Asia alongside of the white
race.</p>

<p>M. Ujfalvy supposes the Eastern Turanians to have
descended the first from the plateau of the Altai; to
be followed by the Western Turanians, who occupied
Northern Europe from time immemorial; the children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
of Noah being the last to quit the primeval home. If
this was so we can well understand that the average
Turanian physical type must present peculiarities
which distinguish it easily from that of the Caucasian
races.</p>

<p>What we have now to do with is the origin of primitive
civilisation, and everything points to the early
Turanians as the people among whom it was developed.
We have already seen that if the primitive Chaldeans
did not belong to the Turanian stock they were intimately
associated with Turanian peoples to whom
they are thought to have been indebted for much of
their culture. The great western division of the
Turanian race appears to have possessed an advanced
civilisation long before its Aryan neighbours. The
Tchoudes, who are described by Ujfalvy as the most
ancient people of the Altaic race, were noted metallurgists,
while the Permians and the Finns are supposed
to have taught art and agriculture to the Slavs and
Scandinavians of Northern Europe. M. Reclus remarks
that, not only did the Turanians teach their
neighbours the use of iron and other metals, but they
have the glory of having given to us most of our
domestic animals, and probably also the greater part
of our most useful cultured plants. Finally, the
Turanians were, says M. Lenormant, “the constructors
of the first towns, and the inventors of metallurgy and
of the first rudiments of the principal arts of civilisation.”
He adds that they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span> “addicted to rites
which were reproved by Yahveh, and were viewed
with as much hatred as superstitious terror by the
populations still in the pastoral state whom they had
preceded in the path of material progress and invention,
but who remained morally more pure and
elevated.”</p>

<p>This description, applied by M. Lenormant to the
Turanians, has reference primarily to the Cainites,
and it carries the origin of material civilisation much
farther back in time than would have been thought
possible a few years ago. The facts mentioned in connection
with Cain and his descendants strikingly confirm
the opinion that the Kushite civilisation was
handed down from a period which, in relation to the
Deluge of Genesis, may be called antediluvian. The
tradition of the Deluge is a primitive belief of the three
white races, the Aryan, the Semitic, and the Hamitic.
It appears to have been originally limited to the peoples
of the Caucasian stock, and this fact requires that the
Turanians should be excluded from the effect of the
supposed catastrophe. The yellow race, therefore, may
claim an “antediluvian” descent, and as Noah, the progenitor
of the white races, belonged to the Sethite
stock, the common ancestor of the Turanian peoples
must have been a Cainite.</p>

<p>The first public event recorded in the life of Cain
after his exile was the building of a town, which he
called Enoch, after his first-born son. This town has
been identified with the city of Khotan, which is
situate in the region where Cain is thought to have
fixed his abode. According to Abel Rémusat the traditions
of that city, preserved in the native chronicles and
referred to by the Chinese historians, go back to a much
earlier period than those of any other city of Central
Asia. Baron d’Eckstein has, moreover, shown that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
Khotan was the centre of a district in which the art of
metallurgy has been practised from the remotest antiquity.
This is important, for Tubal Cain, the youngest
son of Lamekh, the descendant of Cain, is said in
Genesis to have been “an instructor of every artificer
in brass and iron.”</p>

<p>The ancestors of the present Chinese appear not to
have been acquainted with the blacksmith’s art when
they first descended into the plains, although it was
practised by the neighbouring Tibetan tribes, who, we
can hardly doubt, were allied to the Kolarian population
of Eastern India, if not also to the Dravidians
of the south and west. The relationship of the
Dravidians to the peoples of the Altaic stock, and the
practice of metallurgy by the latter particularly, would
tend, however, to prove that the Jabal were not, as
supposed by M. Ujfalvy, Turanians who settled in
Northern Asia and Europe. Those facts would rather
support the view of Knobel, which identifies the Jabal
and the Jubal as a musical and pastoral race, as distinguished
from a settled metallurgic race to whom
the name of Tubal Cain was given.</p>

<p>The opinion that the ancestors of the Turanian
peoples were Cainites may be confirmed by reference
to certain social and religious phenomena. In the
story of the slaying by Cain of his brother Abel there
is evident reference to antagonism between a pastoral
and an agricultural people. M. Lenormant, who sees
a connection between the fratricide and the founding
of the first city, has arrived at the conviction that the
Chaldæo-Babylon tradition concerning the primitive
days of the human race included a reference to those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
two actions of Cain. He says, however, “there are
certain reasons for suspecting that the Chaldeans took
the part of the murderer Cain against Abel, as the
Romans did that of Romulus against Remus.” The
preference of the Chaldeans for the murderer agrees
with the Cainite origin ascribed to their Turanian
ancestors, among whom the polygamy and revenge
attributed to Lamekh were no doubt as prevalent as
among some of their descendants at the present day.
The French writer sees in the fourth chapter of
Genesis a condemnation of Lamekh as the prototype of
fierce vengeance, and at the same time of polygamy.
The whole pre-Deluge history of man, as given in
Genesis, would seem to imply the existence of an
hereditary opposition between the descendants of Cain
and those of Seth, who was regarded as standing in
a special relation to the Shemites. It was evidently
written in the same spirit as that which saw in the
enmity between the Iranians and Turanians a constant
conflict between light and darkness. The race of
Cain are referred in the Biblical narrative as “sons of
men,” a title which implies a condition of religious or
moral inferiority, as compared with the “sons of
God” descended from Seth. That narrative says,
further, that in the time of Enoch men began to call
on the name of Jehovah. This statement, which has
reference only to the Sethites, supposes that the
Cainites invoked some other god, and in the Shamanism
of the Dravidians and various Turanian peoples we
have no doubt a phase of the religious worship prevalent
among their Cainite ancestors.</p>

<p>Another point in connection with religious ideas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
which is of great importance in relation to the above
subject, is the origin of serpent-worship. M. Lenormant
remarks that “the Arcadians made the serpent
one of the principal attributes and one of the forms of
Héa.” This deity, who closely resembles Waïnamoïnen,
one of the three principal gods of the Finns, occupied
a very important position in the Pantheon of the
ancient Chaldeans. Héa, like the Finnish god, was
“not only king of the waters and the atmosphere, he
was also the spirit whence all life proceeded, the
master of favourable spells, the adversary and conqueror
of all personifications of evil, and the sovereign
possessor of all science.” The worship of serpent-gods
is a practice to which many of the primitive
Turanian tribes have been addicted. This accounts
for the curious association of serpent-worship with
Buddhism and Siva-ism. Both of these faiths, as
exhibited in the marvellous sculptures of the ruined
temples of Cambodia, are intimately connected with
serpent-worship. This cult was no doubt very prevalent
among the native populations before the arrival
of the Hindoos, as legend states that the banished Indian
Prince, for whom the city of Nakon-Thom was built,
married a daughter of the King of the Nagas or Serpents,
and became the sovereign of the country. Serpent-worship,
indeed, would seem to have been prevalent
throughout Northern India. The territory of the
king of the serpent city Taxila reached nearly to
Delhi, and it probably extended over Kashmere and
part of Afghanistan. Here was a very important
centre of serpent-worship. General Forlong states
that in Kashmere this cult appears everywhere,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span> “and
the records of the country point to its beautiful lake
and mountain fastnesses as the earliest historic seats
which we have of the faith.” It is remarkable that a
King of the Naga race was reigning in Magadha when
Gautama was born in 626 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, and, according to a
Hindoo legend, even the Buddha himself had a serpent
lineage. If this was so, it is not surprising that his
teachings should be accepted by the Naga races, who
no doubt belonged to the pre-Aryan stock.</p>

<p>The constant introduction of the serpent, especially
of the sacred Cobra, into the sculptures of the Cambodian
temples, is remarkable. M. Moura states that
the ancient Khmers of Cambodia recognised both
good and evil serpents, the former of which lived in
the water and the latter inhabited the land. The
Buddhists of India and Indo-China had the same idea,
and M. Moura supposes that the good serpents represented
the human Nagas who became Buddhists, and
the bad serpents those who refused to abandon their
native serpent-worship. This explanation, however,
is not necessary, as the ancient Egyptians entertained
analogous ideas. No other people, except, perhaps, the
Hindoos and allied races, were more thoroughly
imbued with the serpent superstition than the
Egyptians. Mr. Cooper, in his “Observations on the
Serpent Myths of Ancient Egypt,” remarks that “the
reverence paid to the snake was not merely local, or
even limited to one period of history, but prevailed
alike in every district of the Pharian Empire, and has
left its indelible impress upon the architecture and
the archæology of both Upper and Lower Egypt.”
The Cobra di Capello of the Hindoos and Cambodians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
was the sacred Uræus of the Egyptians. With the
latter it was used as the symbol of fecundity and
immortality, and was also universally assumed as the
“emblem of divine and sacro-regal sovereignty.”
The Uræus was always represented in the female
form, and all the Egyptian goddesses were adorned
with it, as the images of the Hindoo gods were often
surmounted with the sacred Naga. Among the
Egyptians another kind of serpent was also held in
universal veneration. It was a gigantic species of
Coluber, which from the earliest ages was regarded as
“the representative of spiritual, and occasionally
physical, evil.” This was the great snake of the
celestial waters, the adversary of the gods with which
the soul had to contend after death. The Egyptians
had thus a good and an evil serpent, the former of
which was small and the latter large. Among the
Cambodians the reverse was the case, as the small
serpent was the representative of evil, and the great
serpent, the Naga-Naga, of good.</p>

<p>We have already seen that the cobra occupies an
important place in the Buddhist sculpture, and that
the great serpent with its human supporters was represented
at both Amravati and Angkor Wat. Curiously
enough a similar idea to this is represented on certain
Egyptian monuments. On the sarcophagus of Oime-nepthah
I. is sculptured a long serpent, which, says
Mr. Robert Sewell, is doubled into folds just like the
roll of the Buddhist frieze, and having a god standing
on each fold in the places occupied by the sacred
emblems of the Buddhist faith at Amravati. He
supposes the long roll of the Amravati frieze to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
intended to represent a serpent, and to have had its
origin in Western Asian or Egyptian ideas. I had
already, before meeting with this observation, been
struck with the similarity between the Egyptian and
the Buddhist representations, especially when considered
in the light of the Cambodian sculptures which
undoubtedly represent the Naga-Naga. The gigantic
serpent of the celestial ocean of Egyptian mythology is
Aphôphis, the spirit of evil, and in the contest between
him and Horus we have, according to M. Le Page
Renouf, a form of the Indra and Vritra myth. An
Accadian text speaks of “the enormous serpent with
seven heads,” the “serpent which beats the waves of
the sea ... extending his power over heaven
and earth.” This is supposed to refer to Héa, and it
reminds us of the heavenly Naga-Naga of Hindoo
mythology, which, like the Accadian serpent deity,
was representative of the good principle. Such was
also the case among all the old Turanian nations, and
it was only when, as remarked by M. Lenormant, “the
Iranian traditions were fused with the ancient beliefs
of the Proto-Medic religion, the serpent-god naturally
became identified with the representative of the
dark and bad principle.” It cannot be doubted that
this was the later notion, and that the Turanian belief
which associated with the serpent ideas of goodness
was of earlier date. Thus, the Dragon, says Mr.
Doolittle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span> “enjoys an ominous eminence in the affections
of the Chinese people. It is frequently represented
as the greatest benefactor of mankind....
The Chinese delight in praising its wonderful prospects
and powers. It is the venerated symbol of good.”</p>

<p>The veneration of the serpent must have been of
very early origin to occupy so strong a hold over the
Chinese, whose spoken language, according to M.
Terrien de Lacouperie, forms a link between the
Accadian and the Ugro-Finnish divisions of the Ural-Altaic
languages. The art of metallurgy was practised
by the peoples belonging to both these divisions,
and yet, according to M. Lenormant, it was not known
to the early Chinese. We must thus suppose that
the latter left the common home before the invention
of metallurgy, and, therefore, that they represent a
very early condition of the stock from which the
Turanian peoples sprang. We seem, indeed, to be
carried back to the very earliest period of the legendary
history of the Cainite race, and possibly to that
of the legendary ancestor of the race. According to
the tradition preserved in Genesis, there was a peculiar
association between Adam and the serpent. This
animal is there the tempter Satan, but according to
another view Adam, or rather Ad, who was apparently
the traditional ancestor of a portion at least of
the old Turanian stock, was himself the serpent. A
rabbinical tradition makes Cain the son, not of Adam,
but of the serpent-spirit Asmodeus. The name Eve
is connected with an Arabic root which means both
“life” and “a serpent,” and if Eve was the serpent
mother, Ad must have been the serpent father of the
race. There is reason for believing that Adam was
the legendary ancestor of the Cainites, as distinguished
from the descendants of Seth. The name Adam, no
doubt, signifies in the Semitic languages “the man,”
but it has been pointed out that the name borne by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
the son of Seth, and therefore the ancestor of
Noah, that is Enoch, is in Hebrew the exact synonym
of Adam, and also signifies “the man.” There
is, moreover, almost an exact parallel between the
descendants of Adam, through Cain on the one
hand, and those of Seth through Enoch on the other,
and each line is terminated by three heads of races,
that of the Cainites by the sons of Lamekh and that of
the Enocides by the grandsons of Lamekh. In the
latter there is the insertion of one additional generation,
that of Noah, between Lamekh and the division
of the family into three branches. This is, however,
capable of explanation. M. Lenormant shows, by a
comparison of the various legends referring to the
primitive age of mankind, that the number 7 or 10
was used by all the ancient nations as a round number
for the antediluvian ancestors of the race. Tradition
seemed to float between these two numbers until the
influence of the Chaldæo-Babylonians caused the number
10, which is that of the generations of the Sethites,
to dominate over the number 7, that of the Cainites.
It is to that influence we would ascribe the existence
among the descendants of Seth of the legendary
ancestor of the three Caucasian races. The Chaldean
Noah was Khasisatra, whose vessel was saved during
the Flood by the god Héa. This god himself was,
however, supposed to have a vessel in which he sailed
over the celestial ocean. He was, in fact, the fish-god
Oannes, from whom the Chaldeans were said to have
derived their civilisation, and we probably have in
Oannes the point of identification between Héa and
Noah himself. The Caucasian races, whose fathers had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
been saved from the Deluge, could not have a better
legendary ancestor than the divine teacher who, issuing
from the Egyptian sea, was the god Héa, not only the
soul of the watery element but the source of all generation.
If Noah, then, be a mythological being, introduced
into the Sethite genealogy under Chaldean
influence, Lamekh becomes the direct ancestor of the
Caucasian stock as he is of the Turanian peoples. An
argument in favour of this view is furnished by the
Scripture account itself. Among the sons of Noah a
peculiar position is occupied by Ham. He and his
son Canaan are cursed, in like manner as Cain was
cursed. The sins were different, and therefore the
punishments were different, but there appears to be a
kind of parallelism between Cain and Canaan for which
a good reason probably existed in the mind of the
writer of Genesis. We have seen that the Hamites
were intimately connected with peoples belonging to
the Turanian stock, and they were the special recipients
of the old Cainite civilisation. It is, indeed, far from
improbable that they were more Cainite than Sethite.
The three sons of Noah would seem to answer to the
three sons of Adam, and as Ham or Canaan is a reproduction
of Cain, so Japheth and Shem are reproductions
of Abel and Seth. In either case the elder
brothers were put on one side or cursed, that the
youngest brother might enjoy the inheritance. Perhaps
an explanation of this conduct may be found in
the race relationships of the Semites. That they had
a closer affinity to the Hamites than had the Japhethites
is unquestionable, and it can hardly be less doubted
that the latter were the purest branch of the Caucasian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
stock. The Semites were, indeed, a mixed race, but
as the Hebrews professed to be the chosen people it
was necessary that the Hamite and Japhethite races
should be put on one side, as Abel and Cain had been,
that their ancestor Shem might take the chief place.
The Semites thus became the representative Caucasian
people who, as children of light, stand in opposition to
the Turanian Hamites, in like manner as the sons of
Seth were opposed to the descendants of Cain.</p>

<p>We have been led to believe that the civilisation of
the ancient world originated among the Cainites, of
whom the Turanians are the line of descendants. We
have seen reason, moreover, for supposing that the
particular branch of the Turanian stock, among whom
the development of the art of metallurgy first took
place, was the Ural-Altaic, to which the earliest inhabitants
of Chaldea belonged, and whom Dr. Topinard
supposes to be the connecting-link between the fair
types of Europe and the brachycephalic types of Asia.
The building art was one of the earliest to be developed,
as is evident from the reference in Genesis
to the building of a city by Cain. The erection of
the first city is connected with the slaying of Abel,
and therefore the origin of architecture may be referred
back to almost the earliest period of human culture,
and we may well suppose that some of the least
cultured Turanian tribes represent a still earlier stage
of Cainite civilisation. M. Lenormant objects to Herr
Knobel’s theory that the Chinese and the Mongolian
peoples are Cainites, that “the geographical horizon
of the traditions of Genesis did not extend far enough
to include them.” If, however, when the Chinese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
first descended into the plains they were still in the
stone age, they may have been true Cainites, the more
so as their immediate ancestors were located much
nearer than are their descendants to the primeval
home of Adamite man. The remarkable influence
which the veneration for the serpent has obtained
among the Chinese, a superstition which was developed
no less remarkably among the peoples belonging to
the Western branch of the Turanian family, and
through them among the Hamitic peoples, would seem
to prove that it was of primeval origin. The arts of
metallurgy and architecture appear to have had a
later development, and to have originated among the
Turanian Aithiopians or Kuths, to whom the civilisation
of the ancient world was ascribed. After leaving
their home in West-Central Asia they settled in
Chaldea, from whence they gradually spread throughout
Western Asia, Northern Africa, and Europe,
where, in later years, they came in contact with the
Caucasian races, who gave a higher tone to their intellectual
culture and their religious ideas, the latter
being especially observable in the position assigned
to the great serpent as the embodiment of evil.</p>

<small>SACRED PROSTITUTION.</small></h2>


<p>Mr. Darwin, in his work entitled “The Descent of
Man” (vol. ii., p. 361), seems to endorse the opinion
that the high honour bestowed in ancient times on
women who were utterly licentious is intelligible only
“if we admit that promiscuous intercourse was the
aboriginal and therefore the long revered custom of
the tribe,”<a id="FNanchor_230_230" href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> and I propose, in the present chapter, to
show that the fact referred to has nothing at all to
do with the custom sought to be supported by it.</p>

<p>The examples on which Sir John Lubbock relies
have been taken from Dulaure’s work on ancient
religions, but they are more fully detailed in the
“Histoire de la Prostitution” by M. Pierre Dufour,
and they certainly form one of the most remarkable
chapters in the history of morals.</p>

<p>According to Herodotus,<a id="FNanchor_231_231" href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> every woman born in
Babylonia was obliged by law, once in her life, to
submit to the embrace of a stranger. Those who
were gifted with beauty of face or figure soon
completed this offering to Venus, but of the others
some had to remain in the sacred enclosure for several
years before they were able to obey the law. This
statement of Herodotus is confirmed by the evidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
of Strabo, who says the custom dated from the foundation
of the city of Babylon.</p>

<p>The compulsory prostitution of Babylonia was connected
with the worship of Mylitta, and wherever this
worship spread it was accompanied by the sexual
sacrifice. Strabo relates<a id="FNanchor_232_232" href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> that in Armenia the sons
and daughters of the leading families were consecrated
to the service of Anaïtis for a longer or shorter period.
Their duty was to entertain strangers, and those
females who had received the greatest number were on
their return home the most sought after in marriage.
The Phœnician worship of Astarté was no less distinguished
by sacred prostitution, to which was added
a promiscuous intercourse between the sexes during
certain religious fêtes, at which the men and women
exchanged their garments. The Phœnicians carried
the custom to the Isle of Cyprus, where the worship
of their great goddess, under the name of Venus,
became supreme.</p>

<p>According to a popular legend the women of
Amathonte, afterwards noted for its temple, were
originally known for their chastity. When, therefore,
Venus was cast by the waves naked on their
shores, they treated her with disdain, and as a punishment
they were commanded to prostitute themselves
to all comers, a command which they obeyed with so
much reluctance that the goddess changed them into
stone. With their worship of Astarté or Venus, the
Phœnicians introduced sacred prostitution into all their
Colonies. St. Augustine says that, at Carthage, there
were three Venuses rather than one: one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
virgins, another of the married women, and a third
of the courtesans, to the last of whom it was that
the Phœnicians sacrificed the chastity of their daughters
before they were married. It was the same in
Syria. At Byblos during the fêtes of Adonis, after
the ceremony which announced the resurrection of
the God, every female worshipper had to sacrifice to
Venus either her hair or her person. Those who preferred
to preserve the former adjourned to the sacred
enclosures, where they remained for a whole day for
the purpose of prostituting themselves.</p>

<p>The same curious custom appears to have been
practised in Media and Persia, and among the Parthians.
The Lydians were particularly noted for the
zeal with which they practised the rites of Venus.
They did not limit their observance to occasional
attendance at the sacred fêtes, but, says Herodotus,
they devoted themselves to the goddess, and practised,
for their own benefit, the most shameless prostitution.
It is related that a magnificent monument to Alyattes,
the father of Crœsus, was built by the contributions
of the merchants, the artisans, and the courtesans, and
that the portion of the monument erected with the
sum furnished by the courtesans much exceeded both
the other parts built at the expense of the artisans
and merchants.</p>

<p>Some writers deny that sacred prostitution was
practised in Egypt, but the great similarity between
the worship of Osiris and Isis and that of Venus and
Adonis renders the contrary opinion highly probable.
On their way to the fêtes of Isis at Bubastis the female
pilgrims executed indecent dances when the vessels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
passed the villages on the banks of the river. “These
obscenities,” says Dufour, “were only such as were
about to happen at the temple, which was visited each
year by seven hundred thousand pilgrims, who gave
themselves up to incredible excesses.” Strabo asserts
that a class of persons called <i>pellices</i> (harlots) were
dedicated to the service of the patron deity of Thebes,
and that they “were permitted to cohabit with anyone
they chose.” It is true that Sir Gardner Wilkinson<a id="FNanchor_233_233" href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">233</a>
treats this account as absurd, on the ground that the
women, many of whom were the wives and daughters
of the noblest families, assisted in the most important
ceremonies of the temple. This fact is, however,
quite consistent with Strabo’s statement, which may
have referred to an inferior class of female servitors,
and considering the customs of allied peoples, it is
more likely to be true than the reverse. The testimony
of Herodotus is certainly opposed to that of
Strabo. But the former acknowledges that he did
not reveal all that he knew of the secrets of Egyptian
worship, and we must, therefore, receive with some
hesitation his assertion that “the Egyptians are the
first who, from a religious motive, have forbidden
commerce with women in the sacred places, or even
entrance there after having known them, without being
first cleansed.” The Greek historian adds—“Almost
all other peoples, except the Egyptians and the Greeks,
have commerce with women in the sacred places; or,
when they rise from them, they enter there without
being washed.” Whatever may be the truth as to
the inhabitants of ancient Egypt, at the present day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
the dancing girls of that country, who are also prostitutes,
attend the religious festivals just as the ancient
devotees of Astarté are said to have done.</p>

<p>If we test the value of Herodotus’ evidence on the
matter in question by what is known of Grecian customs,
it will have little weight. Sacred prostitution
at Athens was under the patronage of Venus Pandemos,
who is said to have been the first divinity that
Theseus caused the people to adore, or, at least, to
whom a statue was erected on the public place. The
fêtes of that goddess were celebrated on the fourth day
of each month, a chief part in them being assigned to
the prostitutes, who then exercised their calling only
for the profit of the goddess, and they expended in
offerings the money which they had gained under her
auspices. At the height of its prosperity the temple
of Venus at Corinth had, according to Strabo, one
thousand courtesans. It was a common custom in
Greece to consecrate to Venus a certain number of
young girls, when it was desired to render the goddess
favourable, or when she had granted the prayers addressed
to her.</p>

<p>The ordinary Athenian prostitutes appear to have
been dedicated to the public service, and they were
forbidden to leave the country without the consent of
the Archons, who often accorded it only on having a
guarantee that they would return. There would seem
even to have been a College of Prostitutes, which was
declared useful and necessary to the state. The story
of the social influence of the <i>heteræ</i> during the palmiest
days of Greece is too well known to need repetition,
and it will be found fully detailed in the pages of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
Dufour. The majority of the <i>heteræ</i>, however, were
far from being in the position of Aspasia, Laïs, and
others, who were the friends, and even instructors, of
statesmen and philosophers. Although they were
allowed some of the rights of citizenship, they were
often treated with implacable rigour by the Areopagus,
and their children were condemned to the same ignominy
as themselves. Curiously enough, the chief accusation
against the prostitutes was their irreligion,
and although they were priestesses in some temples,
from others they were rigidly excluded.</p>

<p>Among the Romans the prostitute class held a much
lower position in public opinion than with the Greeks,
and for a long time its members were treated as
below the attention of legislators, and were left to the
arbitrary regulation of the police. They were classed
with the slave population as civilly dead, and, having
once become “infamous,” the moral stain was indelible.
Dufour says, as to the religious character of Latin
prostitution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>—“The courtesans at Rome were not, as in
Greece, kept at a distance from the altars. On the
contrary, they frequented all the temples, in order,
no doubt, to find their favourable chances of gain;
they showed their gratitude to the divinity who had
been propitious to them, and they brought to his
sanctuary a portion of the gain which they believed
they owed to him. Religion closed its eyes to this
impure source of revenue and offerings; civil legislation
did not intermeddle with these details of false
devotion, which concerned only religion; and, thanks
to that tolerance, or rather the systematic abstention
from judicial and religious control, sacred prostitution
preserved at Rome nearly its primitive features, with
this difference, nevertheless, that it was always confined
to the class of courtesans, and that, instead of
being an integral part of worship, it was a foreign
accessory to it.” According to some Roman writers,
however, Acca Laurentia (the foster-mother of Romulus
and Remus), in whose honour the Lupercales were
instituted, was a prostitute, and the fêtes of Flora had
a similar origin. The goddess of flowers was originally
a courtesan, who made an enormous fortune,
which she left to the state. Her legacy was accepted,
and the Senate, in gratitude, decreed that the name
of Flora should be inscribed in the fastes of the state,
and that solemn fêtes should perpetuate the memory
of her generosity. These fêtes always preserved
a remembrance of their origin, and were accompanied
by the most scandalous scenes, which were publicly
enacted in the circus.</p>

<p>The religious prostitutes of antiquity find their
counterparts in the dancing girls attached to the
Hindoo temples. These “female slaves of the
idol” are girls who have been dedicated to the
temple service, often by their own parents, and
they act both as dancing girls and courtesans.
Notwithstanding their calling, they are treated with
great respect, and such would seem always to have
been the case, if we may judge by the ancient legend
which relates that Gautama was entertained at Vesali
by a lady of high rank who had the title of “Chief of
the Courtesans.”<a id="FNanchor_234_234" href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> No doubt the attention paid to the
appearance and education of the temple prostitutes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
has much to do with the respect with which they are
treated, the position accorded by the ancient Greeks
to the superior class of <i>heteræ</i> being due to an analogous
cause.</p>

<p>Bishop Heber says, in relation to the Bayadêres of
Southern India, that they differ considerably from the
Nautch girls of the Northern Provinces, “being all in
the service of different temples, for which they are
purchased young, and brought up with a degree of
care which is seldom bestowed on the females of
India of any other class. This care not only extends
to dancing and singing, and the other allurements of
their miserable profession, but to reading and writing.
Their dress is lighter than the bundle of red cloth
which swaddles the <i>figuranté</i> of Hindostan, and their
dancing is more indecent; but their general appearance
and manner seemed to me far from immodest,
and their air even more respectable than the generality
of the lower classes of India.... The money which
they acquire in the practice of their profession is
hallowed to their wicked gods, whose ministers are
said to turn them out without remorse, or with a very
scanty provision, when age or sickness renders them
unfit for their occupation. Most of them, however,
die young.” The Bishop adds,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span> “I had heard that the
Bayadêres were regarded with respect among the
other classes of Hindoos, as servants of the gods, and
that, after a few years’ service, they often marry
respectably. But, though I made several inquiries,
I cannot find that this is the case; their name is a
common term of reproach among the women of the
country, nor could any man of decent caste marry
one of their number.”<a id="FNanchor_235_235" href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> The courtesans of Hindostan
do not appear to be attached to the temples, but
Tavernier relates that they made offerings to certain
idols, to whom they surrendered themselves when
young to bring good fortune.</p>

<p>The chief facts connected with religious prostitution
have now been given, and it remains only to show
that this system has nothing to do with any custom
of communal marriage, or promiscuous intercourse
between the sexes, such as it is thought to give
evidence of. Sir John Lubbock says that the life
led by the courtesans attached to the Hindoo temples
is not considered shameful, because they continue the
old custom of the country under religious sanction.
This statement, however, is wholly inaccurate, as the
former existence of the custom referred to cannot be
established. The social phenomena which are thought
to establish that mankind has passed through a stage
of promiscuity in the intercourse between the sexes
are capable of totally different interpretation. The
ease with which any doctrine or practice, however
absurd or monstrous, will be accepted, if it possesses a
religious sanction, would alone account for the respect
entertained for religious prostitutes. But among a
people who, like the Hindoos, view sexual immorality
for personal gain with abhorrence, such a calling, if it
were based on so barbarous a custom as communal
marriage, would inevitably lessen rather than increase
that sentiment. On the other hand, if the religious
position accorded to the temple prostitutes is connected
with ideas which have a sacredness of their own, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
respect will be greatly increased. And thus, in fact,
it is. Probably no custom is more widely spread
than the providing for a guest a female companion,
who is usually a wife or daughter of the host. Such
a connection with a stranger is permitted even among
peoples who are otherwise jealous preservers of female
chastity. This custom of sexual hospitality is said to
have been practised by the Babylonians in the time
of Alexander, although, according to the Roman
historian, parents and husbands did not decline to
accept money in return for the favours thus accorded.
Eusebius asserts that the Phœnicians prostituted their
daughters to strangers, and that this was done for the
greater glory of hospitality. So, also, we find that at
Cyprus the women who devoted themselves to the
good goddess walked about the shores of the island
to attract the strangers who disembarked.</p>

<p>In the earliest phase of what is called sacred prostitution
it was not every man who was entitled to
enjoy its privileges. The Babylonian women, who
were compelled to make a sacrifice of their persons
once in their lives, submitted to the embraces only of
strangers. In Armenia, also, strangers alone were
entitled to seek sexual hospitality in the sacred
enclosures at the temple of Anaïtis, and it was the
same in Syria during the fêtes of Venus and Adonis.
Dufour was struck by this fact, and, speaking of it, he
says, “It may be thought surprising that the inhabitants
of the country were so impressed with a worship
in which their women had all the benefit of the
mysteries of Venus.” He adds, however, that the
former were not less interested than the latter in these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
mysteries. “The worship of Venus was in some sort
stationary for the women, nomadic for the men, seeing
that these could visit in turn the different fêtes and
temples of the goddess, profiting everywhere, in these
sensual pilgrimages, by the advantages reserved to
guests and to strangers.”</p>

<p>Besides hospitality, the practice of which is, under
ordinary circumstances, an almost sacred duty with
uncultured peoples, there was another series of ideas
associated with the system of sacred prostitution. In
the East, the great aim of woman’s life is marriage
and bearing children. We have a curious reference
to this fact in the lament of the Hebrew women for
Jephthah’s daughter, which appears to have been
occasioned less by her death than by the recorded fact
that “she knew no man.” When she heard of the vow
made by her father, she said to him, “Let me alone
two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains
and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.” The
desire of the wife, however, is not merely for children,
but for a man-child, the necessity for which has given
rise to the practice of adoption; another custom which
Sir John Lubbock believes to support his favourite
doctrine of communal marriage. In India adoption is
practised when a man has no son of his own, and it
has a directly religious motive. Sir Thomas Strange
shows that the Hindoo law of inheritance cannot be
understood without reference to the belief that a
man’s future happiness depends “upon the performance
of his obsequies and the payment of his [spiritual]
debts.” He who pays these debts is his heir; and, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
“offerings from sons are more effectual than offerings
from other persons, sons are first in order of succession.”
Hence to have a son is to the Hindoo a sacred
duty, and when his wife bears no children, or only
daughters, he is compelled by his religious belief to
adopt one. We can understand how anxious for a
son women must be where those ideas prevail, and
this anxiety has given rise to various curious ceremonies
having for their object to prevent or cure
sterility. Some of these, which have been described
by Dulaure and other writers, existed in Europe
down to a comparatively recent period. In India,
and probably in some other Eastern countries, they
are still practised both by wives who have continued
childless and by newly-married women, the latter
offering to the <i>Linga</i> the sacrifice of their virginity.</p>

<p>This desire for children led to offerings being made
to ensure the coveted blessing, and to vows to be
performed on its being obtained. The nature of the
vow would undoubtedly have some reference to the
thing desired; and, as related by an old Arabian
traveller in India, “when a woman has made a vow
for the purpose of having children, if she brings into
the world a pretty daughter, she carries it to <i>Bod</i> (so
they call the idol which they adore), and leaves it
with him.” The craving for children was anciently
as strong among Eastern peoples as it is at the present
day, and it is much more probable that this, rather
than a habit of licentiousness, either of the women
themselves or of the priests, led to the sacrifice at the
shrine of Mylitta. If we are to believe Herodotus,
the Babylonian women were in his time noted for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
their virtue, although at a later period they would
seem to have lost that characteristic.</p>

<p>The desire for children is directly opposed to the
feeling which would operate in the case of communal
marriage, where parents and children, having no
special relation, no one would have any particular
interest in preserving the issue of such intercourse.
Among the uncultured peoples of the present era who
the most nearly approach in their sexual relations to a
state of communal marriage, the indifference to children
is often apparent. Infanticide is very general, and abortion
is often practised by the women to enable them
to retain the favour of their husbands. The sacred
prostitution, which is intimately connected with the
craving for children, must, therefore, have originated
at a time when a considerable advance had been made
in social culture.</p>

<p>It would not be surprising if the ancient Babylonish
custom had, of itself, resulted in a system of sacred
prostitution. The act of sexual intercourse was in the
nature of an offering to the Goddess of Fecundity, and
a life of prostitution in the service of the goddess
might well come to be viewed as pleasing to her
and as deserving of respect at the hands of her
worshippers. We have an analogous phase of
thought in the Japanese notion, that a girl who
enters the Yoshiwara for the purpose of thus supporting
her parents performs a highly meritorious act.
In Armenia, as we have seen, children were devoted
by their parents to the service of the great goddess
for a term of years, and those who had received the
most numerous favours from strangers were the most
eagerly sought after in marriage on the expiration of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
that period. That dedication was in pursuance of a
vow, which no doubt, like the vows of Indian women
at the present day, would at first have relation to
some sexual want, although thank-offerings of the same
character would afterwards come to be presented
by the worshippers of the goddess for blessings of any
description. Thus Xenophon consecrated fifty courtesans
to the Corinthian Venus, in pursuance of the
vow which he had made when he besought the goddess
to give him the victory in the Olympian games.
Pindar makes Xenophon thus address these slaves of
the goddess: “Oh, young damsels, who receive all
strangers and give them hospitality, priestesses of the
goddess Pitho in the rich Corinth, it is you who, in
causing the incense to burn before the images of Venus
and in invoking the mother of love, often merit for us
her celestial aid, and procure for us the sweet moments
which we taste on the luxurious couches where is
gathered the delicate fruit of beauty.”</p>

<p>The legitimate inference to be made from what has
gone before is that sacred prostitution sprang from the
primitive custom of providing sexual hospitality for
strangers, the agents by which it was carried out being
supplied by the votaries of the deity under whose
sanction the custom was placed. Assuming its existence,
and the strong desire on the part of married
women for children, which led them to sacrifice their
own virginity as an offering to the Goddess of Fecundity,
or to dedicate their daughters to her service, we have
a perfect explanation of the custom of sacred prostitution.
The duty of these “servants of the idol”
would include the furnishing of hospitality to the
strangers who visited the shrines and fêtes of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
deity. These pilgrims became the guests of the deity,
and she was bound to furnish them with the same
hospitality as that which they would have met with if
they had been entertained by private individuals.
The piety of her worshippers enabled her to do this,
either by devoting their daughters for a limited
period to this sacred service, in return for which the
reward of fecundity would be looked for, or by
presenting them absolutely to the goddess in return
for favours received at her hands. It is not surprising
that among peoples having such notions, the temple
courtesans were regarded with great respect, nor that
those who had acted in that capacity with success
were eagerly sought after as wives. It is more difficult
to understand how sexual hospitality should have
come to be placed under divine sanction. The difficulty
vanishes, however, when the light in which the
process of generation is viewed in the East is considered.
That which by us is looked upon as due to
a passionate impulse, was anciently (except among
certain religious sects), and is still to the Eastern
mind, an act of mysterious significance. The male
organ of generation was the symbol of creative power,
and the veneration in which it was held led to practices
which to a modern European are nothing but
disgusting, although to the Semite they partake of a
purely religious character.</p>

<p>To pursue this subject further would be to enter
upon the wide field of Phallic worship. Sufficient has,
however, already been said to prove that sacred prostitution
is only remotely connected, if at all, with
communal marriage. The only apparent connection
between them is the sexual hospitality to strangers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
which the former was established to supply; but the
association is only apparent, as the providing
of that hospitality is perfectly consistent with the
recognition of the value of female chastity, and is
quite independent of any ideas entertained as to
marriage.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I may add that the opinion expressed
by Sir John Lubbock,<a id="FNanchor_236_236" href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> that the Grecian <i>hetæræ</i> were
more highly esteemed than the married women,
because the former were originally countrywomen
and relations, and the latter captives and slaves, is not
consistent with the facts of the case. Any one conversant
with the social customs of ancient Greece will
be able to give a totally different explanation of that
phenomenon. Marriage with foreign women was forbidden,
and thus captives and slaves furnished the
Greeks with concubines and prostitutes, while their
wives were taken from among their own countrywomen.
Even such was the case in the earliest
heroic ages, when, says Mr. Gladstone, the intercourse
between husband and wife was “thoroughly natural,
full of warmth, dignity, reciprocal deference, and
substantial, if not conventional delicacy.” The same
writer says: “The relations of youth and maiden
generally are indicated with extreme beauty and
tenderness in the Iliad; and those of the unmarried
woman to a suitor, or probable spouse, are so portrayed,
in the case of the incomparable Nausicaa, as
to show a delicacy and freedom that no period of
history or state of manners can surpass.”<a id="FNanchor_237_237" href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">237</a></p>

<small>MARRIAGE AMONG PRIMITIVE PEOPLES.</small></h2>


<p>The usual idea associated with the term “marriage”
is the union in domestic life of a single pair of
individuals, and with few exceptions this is the
only marriage recognised by Christian peoples. We
learn from the Old Testament Scriptures that the
Hebrews had different ideas on that subject. They
not only considered it allowable for a man to have
more than one wife, but apparently they thought he
might have as many wives as he chose. This system
of marriage, to which the term polygamy has been
usually applied, is still prevalent in most countries
outside of the European area. The monogamous and
polygamous forms of marriage are, however, by no
means the only possible ones. Instead of a man
and a woman living together, a number of individuals
may thus associate, and in lieu of a man having several
wives a woman may conceivably have more than one
husband. Moreover, marriage may be subject to
varying regulations or restrictions, causing the same
system to present dissimilar features in different localities.
That which is <i>possible</i> in social life may reasonably
be expected to occur somewhere or other on the
earth’s surface; and, as a fact, all the types of marriage
referred to are to be found among peoples of the
Eastern Hemisphere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span></p>

<p>It can hardly be doubted that the most civilised
races, of which we may call the modern world, have,
with the exception of the Chinese, belonged to the two
great branches of the Caucasian stock, the Aryan and
the Semitic-speaking peoples. Those races, and especially
such of them as inhabit the Western part of the
Old Continent, have shown a preference for monogamy
or polygamy, the former being almost restricted
to Europeans, the latter being nearly universal
among the Asiatic portion of the Caucasian stock.
The inferior races, however, possess the least advanced
systems of marriage. The natives of the Australian
Continent are usually regarded as the most uncivilised
of mankind, and among them there has been developed
a system which some persons would probably consider
not entitled to the name of marriage. In it individuals
give place theoretically to groups, between
whom the marriage relation is supposed to be formed,
the individuals being treated only as members of a
group. The existence of this peculiar system has
been established by the inquiries of the Rev. Lorimer
Fison, who has shown, moreover, that Australian
marriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span> “is something more than the marriage of
group to group, <i>within a tribe</i>. It is an arrangement,
extending across a Continent, which divides many
widely-scattered tribes into intermarrying classes, and
gives a man of one class marital rites over women of
another class in a tribe a thousand miles away, and
speaking a language other than his own. It seems to
be strong evidence of the common origin of all the
Australian tribes among whom it prevails; and it is a
striking illustration of how custom remains fixed while
language changes.”<a id="FNanchor_238_238" href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> An American writer, Mr. Lewis
Morgan, who was the first to point out the prevalence
among the less cultured races of mankind of relationship
which he terms “<i>classificatory</i>,” in opposition to
the <i>descriptive</i> relationships of the superior races, states
that, according to Australian marriage, “a group of
males distinguished by the same class name are the
born husbands of a group of females bearing another
class name; and whenever a male of this class meets
a female of the other class, they recognise each other
as husband and wife, and their right to live in this
relation is regarded by the tribe to which they belong.”
The peculiarity of this system is, not that each individual
is entitled to take a wife or husband out of a
particular group, but that, in theory, every individual
is from birth the husband or wife of all the members
of a special group. Mr. Fison remarks further that
the idea of marriage under that system is founded on
the rights neither of the woman nor of the man. It
is based “on the rights of the tribe, or rather of the
classes into which the tribe is divided. Class marriage
is not a contract entered into by two parties. It is a
natural state into which both parties are born, and they
have to be content with that state whereunto they are
called.” But what is the nature of the social organisation
to which the system of group marriage
belongs? At the present time nearly all the existing
Australian tribes are divided into four classes, into
one of which every individual is born. The members
of each class are supposed to trace their descent to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
same common female ancestor, they are treated as of
the same degrees of kinship to each other, and they are
not allowed to intermarry. There is reason to believe
that originally, perhaps when the ancestors of all the
existing tribes resided in the same neighbourhood,
each tribe consisted of only two classes. In this
case, the law of group marriage, under the regulations
as to marriage and descent just mentioned, would
require that all the members of each class should be
real or tribal brothers and sisters of each other, and
the husbands and wives of all the members of the
other class. The theoretical result would be, that all
the men of each class would have their wives in common,
and all the women of each class their husbands in
common. Whether the number of individuals in each
group was large or small, the result would be the
same. In practice, the exercise of the extended marriage
right would be restricted to a few individuals,
but that its existence is generally understood is shown
by the statement of a native servant, who had travelled
far and wide in Australia, that “he was furnished
with temporary wives by the various tribes with whom
he sojourned in his travels; that his right to those
women was recognised as a matter of course; and that
he could always ascertain whether they belonged to
the division into which he could legally marry,
though the places were a thousand miles apart, and
the languages quite different.” This particular case
might, perhaps, be explained as an extreme example
of the granting of sexual hospitality; but Mr. Fison
refers to several facts which prove the reality of the
relationships arising out of group marriage, and there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>fore
of this system itself. He states that an Australian
“has the rights of a brother, and he acknowledges the
duties of a brother, towards every man of his own
group; and he can no more marry a woman of a
group which is ‘sister’ to his own than we can marry
our own sister.” Among the Australians, as among
some other races who are supposed to have had at
one time a similar marriage system, a mother-in-law
and a son-in-law mutually avoid each other. This
conduct is based on the fact that the mother-in-law
belongs to the class of women over whom the son-in-law
has a marital right, but as she is <i>specially</i> forbidden
to him they must keep out of each other’s way. Again,
the incidents attendant on adoption are in accordance
with the reality of group relationships. A person who
is adopted into a gens or family “forthwith abandons
all the relationships of his own gens, and takes those
of the gens into which he is adopted,” a result which
is due to the fact that relationship is conceived, not
between individual and individual, but between group
and group. Extraordinary as is the Australian system
at the present time, when each class, or intermarrying
group, embraces so many individuals, it would not
appear so strange if, as was originally the case, each
group consisted only of the immediate descendants of
the common female ancestor. In this case all the
males in any particular generation of each family group
would be the husbands of all the females in the same
generation of the other family; in other words, all the
men of each group would have their wives in common
and all the women their husbands in common.
Moreover, the actual practice of the Australian tribes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
differs from the theory. Every man and every woman
is permanently married to an individual of the opposite
sex, and often this connection is formed at an
early age by arrangement between the parents of the
persons concerned. In addition, however, each of
these persons may be allotted by the great council of the
tribe as an “accessory spouse,” or <i>pirauru</i>, to some other
individual. The Australian system, therefore, presents
a mixture of individual marriage and group marriage,
the latter of which is evidently closely connected with
the right of sexual hospitality, which is considered by
the savage mind as natural and of great importance.</p>

<p>Australian marriage is thus based on what may be
theoretically termed the natural marriage between
two groups of individuals whose wishes are never consulted
in the matter. The same arrangement might,
of course, be made among the individuals themselves,
and, curiously enough, a form of group marriage,
much restricted in its operation, was at one time fully
recognised among the Polynesian Islands of the Pacific.
This system was known as <i>punalua</i>, and it consisted
in two or more brothers having their wives, or two or
more sisters having their husbands, in common. Here,
brothers and sisters form one group, and the wives of
the one with the husbands of the other, themselves
being brothers and sisters (actual or tribal), form
another group answering to the intermarrying classes
of the Australians. The Polynesian <i>punalua</i> and the
Australian group marriage are, therefore, fundamentally
the same.<a id="FNanchor_239_239" href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> The Australian system is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
much the more comprehensive, however, as it affects
all the members of a class, while the Polynesian affects
only the persons immediately concerned. Each punaluan
group appears to be formed independently, with
the consent of all the parties to the arrangement, and
without conferring any sexual right on the children
belonging to it. This is totally unlike the Australian
practice, which recognises individuals only as members
of particular groups, standing to each other in a certain
marital relation and perpetuated by descent
through their female members. The latter may be
described as <i>hereditary</i> punalua, as distinguished from
the Polynesian system, which is purely personal.</p>

<p>Mr. Morgan points out that <i>punalua</i> may be of two
forms, one founded on the brotherhood of the husbands,
and the other on the sisterhood of the wives, the men
of each group being polygamous and the women polyandrous.
Both forms of that marriage arrangement
are said to have existed among the natives of America,
although, when discovered by Europeans, the family
with them was founded on marriage between single
pairs, but without exclusive cohabitation. Thus, it was
not uncommon for a man who married an eldest
daughter to claim all his wife’s sisters, and he appears
to have occasionally allowed his brothers to participate
in the matrimonial privileges. In other cases, a
man married the sister of his deceased wife as a
matter of course, but he did not take her in his
wife’s lifetime. Similar customs exist in some
parts of Australia, where the old system of marriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
has been almost forgotten. The polyandrous form of
punalua was known to the Australians either as a
feature of the group right, or in the course of its decadence.
Thus, every woman had accessory husbands
or paramours who associated with her temporarily,
notwithstanding that she had a recognised husband
with whom she habitually cohabited. Mr. T. E.
Lance mentions a tribe in which most of the women
are nominally the wives of elderly men, who are,
however, obliged to lend them on stated occasions to
the younger men of the allowed classes.</p>

<p>It is evident that circumstances may favour the
development of either the polyandrous or the polygamous
form of punalua to the exclusion of the
other. A scarcity of women would tend to the establishment
of the former system, as we see in the case
of the Todas of Southern India. This fine race of
hillmen were inveterate practisers of female infanticide
down to a recent date, and it was almost the universal
practice for a family of near relations to live together
in one hut, having wife, children, and cattle in common.<a id="FNanchor_240_240" href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">240</a>
The continued formation of such alliances
appears to have led to a result much resembling the
group marriage of the Australians. As Colonel Marshall
states, “the family come to be represented
mainly by a knot of brothers, half-brothers, and
cousins, married to closely related kinswomen in
nearly equal numbers; the men being the common
fathers of all the progeny; each woman, however,
the mother of her own children only.”<a id="FNanchor_241_241" href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> The Todas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
have, under British influence, given up the practice
of infanticide, but they have fewer female than male
children, owing to a preponderance of male births, and
polyandry is still customary among them. A woman
is at first married with her own consent to one man,
who pays the dowry. Afterwards, however, “if the
husband has brothers, or very near relatives, all
living together, they may each, if both she and he
consent, participate in the right to be considered her
husband also, on making up a share of the dowry that
has been paid.”<a id="FNanchor_242_242" href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> Notwithstanding the example of
the Todas, it must not be thought that a scarcity of
women is essential to the existence of polyandry.
In Tibet this system of marriage is universal, and it
has been so from time immemorial. Nevertheless,
unmarried women are numerous, and infanticide is
not practised. Mr. Andrew Wilson defined Tibetan
polyandry as the marriage of one woman to two or
more brothers, and these are actual brothers, although
at one time probably they may also have been tribal.
The choice of a wife is the right of the elder brother, and
Mr. Wilson states<a id="FNanchor_243_243" href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> that “among the Tibetan-speaking
people it universally prevails that the contract he
makes is understood to involve a marital contract with
all the brothers, if they choose to avail themselves
of it.” Moreover, all the children of the marriage
belong to the eldest brother, as the head of the
family group. In Ladak,<a id="FNanchor_244_244" href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> however, the consent of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
the younger brothers is required to the marital partnership,
although on the death of the eldest brother
his authority, with his property and his widow, devolve
upon his next brother, whether or not there has been
a polyandrous arrangement. Mr. Wilson observes<a id="FNanchor_245_245" href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">245</a>
that Tibetan polyandry had the effect “of checking
the increase of population in regions from which emigration
is difficult, and where it is also difficult to
increase the means of subsistence.” It is due to an
artificial scarcity of <i>wives</i>, rather than of women, in
which it differs from the polyandry of the Todas,
which is the consequence of an actual scarcity of
females, caused originally by the practice of infanticide,
and afterwards by a preponderance of male
births. Both the Tibetans and the Todas trace
descent through the male line—that is, take the
family or gentile name of the father; but some peoples
of Southern India, who practice polyandry, prefer the
female line. This is not surprising, when we find, as
among the Nairs of Malabar, that not only has a
woman several husbands, but a man “may be one in
several combinations of husbands.” Such unions,
which are governed by certain restrictions as to tribe
and caste, closely resemble the Australian group
marriage. In Ceylon, where polyandry is very prevalent
among the Kandyans, marriage is of two forms,
one termed <i>deega</i>, in which the wife goes to live in
the house and village of her husband or husbands,
the other, termed <i>beena</i>, in which the husband or husbands
come to reside with her in the house of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
birth. The Tibetan polyandry may be a form of the
<i>deega</i> marriage, and the Nair polyandry a form of
the <i>beena</i> marriage, although it is possible that the
latter may be a “mere freak,” if it be true (as Mr.
Wilson affirms) that the Nairs are nominally married
to girls of their own caste, but never have any intercourse
with their wives, who may have as many
lovers as they please, provided they are Brahmins
or Nairs, other than the husband. These lovers
answer to the paramours of the Australian system, but,
whereas the latter occupy a secondary place, among
the Nairs it is the husband who is in that position.
This custom may not improbably be explained by
the remarks of a Mohammedan writer, who says,<a id="FNanchor_246_246" href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> with
regard to the marriages of the Brahmins of Malabar,
“when there are several brothers in one family, the
eldest of them alone enters into the conjugal state
(except in cases where it is evident that he will have
no issue), the remainder refraining from marriage, in
order that heirs may not multiply to the confusion of
inheritance. The younger brothers, however, intermarry
with women of the Nair caste without entering
into any compact with them, thus following the custom
of the Nairs, who have themselves no conjugal
contract. In the event of any children being born
from these connections, they are excluded from the
inheritance; but should it appear evident that the
elder brother will not have issue, then another brother,
the next to him in age, will marry.” The irregular
marriages with the Nair women were, perhaps, intro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>duced
by the Brahmins to provide wives for the
brothers of their caste who were not allowed to marry.
The original Nair polyandry may have been similar to
that of the carpenters, ironsmiths, painters, and other
Malabar castes, who (says the same writer) “cohabit,
two or more together, with one woman, but not unless
they are brothers, or in some way related, lest confusion
should ensue in the inheritance of property.”</p>

<p>It is thought, from certain facts mentioned in the
Mahá Bhárata, that polyandry was a recognised institution
among the early Hindus, and that the eldest
brother had the right, as now among the Tibetans, to
choose a wife for the family. Some writers have
gone so far even as to assert that all the peoples of
the primitive Aryan stock, and our own British ancestors
amongst them, practised the same custom or some
form of group marriage. Mr. J. F. M’Lennan regarded
the Hebrew law of the Levirate, which required a
younger son to take his elder brother’s widow if he
had died childless, as having been derived from the
practice of polyandry. Whether this was so, or
whether it was merely a regulation to prevent the
elder branch of a stock from becoming extinct, traces
of polyandry have undoubtedly been met with among
peoples of the Semitic stock. It would seem, however,
to have been most prevalent among the tribes of
Southern Arabia, and it was probably due, chiefly to
the poverty of the people,<a id="FNanchor_247_247" href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> as among the Tibetans,
who may have directly influenced the development of
polyandry in Arabia. The true marriage system of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
the Semitic peoples was punalua of the polygamous
form, in which several sisters had a husband in common.
We have an instance of it in the marriage of
Jacob with the sisters Leah and Rachel. At a later
period, however, when blood or even tribal relationship
between the wives was not required, the practice
of polygamy became fully established. This system
has attained its chief development among the Semitic
races and those African peoples who are allied to
them by blood. The most widely-spread forms of
marriage now existing are polygamy and monogamy,
and while the former may be traced to the polygamous
phase of punalua or group marriage, it is not improbable
that the latter is traceable to the polyandrous
phase. At all events, monogamy has been established
chiefly among those races who are supposed, formerly,
to have been polyandrous. The Australians, among
whom group marriage has reached so full a development,
are said to show a tendency to the introduction of individual
marriage. Descent through the female line,
which was, at one time, universal among them, is
giving place to descent through males, where residence
has become fixed and property accumulated. The
change is accompanied by a weakening of the group
right, and the gradual introduction of marriage “by
gifts, by exchange, by capture, and by elopement, one
or other of these predominating.” The rights of the
individual are thus substituted for those of the group,
and individual marriage is recognised.</p>

<p>Strange as are the various marriage systems we
have referred to, they are based on the very simple
principle that every individual has a sexual right.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
The conditions under which this right may be exercised
vary among different peoples, their operation
giving rise to the peculiar married arrangements in
question. Among the Australians, almost the only
restriction on sexual unions appears to be that arising
from consanguinity. Their marriage regulations have
evidently been formed with the intention of absolutely
prohibiting unions between persons near of kin.
Although marriage with a sister of the half-blood is
often permitted, and for special reasons marriage with
a full sister may be allowed, the objection to consanguineous
unions may be declared to be universal
among peoples of a low degree of culture. Their marriage
regulations, however, are generally intended to
have certain positive results. The chief result aimed
at would seem to be the prevention of over-population.
This fact, combined with the recognition of the
sexual rights of man, accounts for the polyandry of
the Tibetans and the Hindus, and the attainment of
it is in many cases aided by the practice of infanticide.
Polygamy, on the other hand, has no apparent relation
to the question of population. It is connected
rather with the rights of the gens or family to which
the women belong, the man having, in many cases,
certain duties to perform before he can obtain his
wife or wives. The development of polygamy is,
moreover, attended with an invasion of the sexual
rights of individuals; as the appropriation of the
women by the rich or powerful often renders the
obtaining of wives by the poor or weak difficult, if not
impossible.</p>

<p>The objection entertained by peoples of a low<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
degree of culture to the marriage of persons near of
kin is a strong ground of objection to Mr. Morgan’s
theory that consanguineous unions were the earliest to
be formed; in other words, that “promiscuous intermarriage
between brothers and sisters and others of
the closest kin” was, at one time, customary. Mr.
Fison refers to various practices which he thinks point
to the former existence of such a state of things among
the Australians. In reality, however, they are merely
incidents of the group marriage which has been
developed by that race, or at most, the result of temporary
suspension under special circumstances of the
restrictions which that system enforces. They are,
indeed, cases of licentiousness similar to what is often
met with among many peoples during religious and
other festivals. The occurrence of a temporary condition
of lawlessness on various occasions, such as the
death of a chief or the celebration of an important
event, is not unknown even to civilised nations. Mr.
Morgan’s opinion as to the former prevalence of consanguineous
marriages derives no real support from the
fact mentioned by Mr. Fison, and as I have elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_248_248" href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">248</a>
shown, marriages of that character are not required to
account for the phenomena exhibited in the classificatory
system of relationship which exists among the
primitive races of mankind.</p>

<small>MARRIAGE BY CAPTURE.</small></h2>


<p>Various attempts have been made to account for
the prevalence among peoples of all degrees of culture
of what has been called “marriage by capture,” or of
rites which furnish evidence of its former existence.
Mr. M’Lennan traces it to infanticide, which by
“rendering women scarce, led at once to polyandry
within the tribe, and the capturing of women from
without.” On the other hand, Sir John Lubbock
ascribes the origin of “marriage by capture” to a
desire on the part of individuals to acquire women for
themselves, “without infringing on the general rights
of the tribe.” According to this view, communal
marriage was replaced by special connections, accompanied
by the introduction of a foreign element,
giving rise to the practice of <i>exogamy</i>. The reference
to this practice (the necessity for which must, if Mr.
M’Lennan’s idea is correct, have preceded “marriage
by capture,” instead of the latter originating it) unnecessarily
complicates the question under discussion.</p>

<p>Although exogamy is often associated with forcible
marriage, the two things are perfectly distinct, and
they have had totally different origins. Mr. Morgan
very justly connects the former with certain ideas
entertained by primitive peoples with regard to blood
relationship, and it can be explained most simply and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
rationally as <i>marriage out of the clan</i>, it having sprang
from the belief that all the members of a clan are
related by blood, and therefore incapable of being
united in marriage. This view is confirmed by the
fact that tribes which are <i>endogamous</i> in relation to
other tribes are <i>exogamous</i> in the sense that they
comprise several clans, the members of none of which
can intermarry among themselves. We have a curious
example of this limited exogamy in the Chinese,
among whom persons bearing the same family name
are not permitted to intermarry. True endogamy
would seem to exist among very few peoples, and
when it is practised the custom is probably due to
special circumstances, which, giving prominence to a
particular clan, have enabled them to claim a caste
privilege, or it may be owing to a necessity arising
from the complete severance of the members of a clan
from their fellows. The scarcity of women, whether
occasioned by infanticide or polygamy, may have
rendered exogamy more requisite, and it may have
been complicated by forcible marriage, but none of
these have any real bearing on its origin.</p>

<p>It could be shown without difficulty that the opinion
entertained by the writers I have referred to, that the
primitive condition of man was one of communal
marriage, is untenable, and if I am correct in this conclusion,
there will be no occasion to consider the argument
that “marriage by capture” depended on such a
social condition. The idea that “marriage by capture”
originated in the necessity for exogamy, arising from
infanticide or some other practice, is more plausible,
and such an explanation of the custom may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
accepted where it is not universal in a tribe, but
resorted to only in particular cases or under special
conditions. The capture of wives among the Australian
aborigines is expressly accounted for by Oldfield as
being due to the scarcity of women. But where
forcible marriage can be traced to the action of individual
caprice it must be treated as exceptional, and
some other explanation must be sought for the widespread
practices which are supposed to prove the former
prevalence of that custom. From this standpoint Mr.
M’Lennan’s explanation is far from satisfactory, as may
be shown by analysis of the incidents attendant on
“marriage by capture,” as practised by different peoples.</p>

<p>It is true that sometimes the carrying off of the
bride is resisted by her friends, and is attended in
some cases, as among the Welsh down to a comparatively
recent period, by a sham fight between them
and the friends of the bridegroom; although among
other peoples, as with the Khonds of India, the protection
of the bride is left to her female companions.
In the great majority of cases cited by Sir John
Lubbock, however, the suitor forcibly removes the
bride without any hindrance from her friends. Occasionally,
as with the Tunguses, the New Zealanders,
and the Mandingos, she strongly resists. Among
other peoples, as with the Esquimaux, the resistance
is usually only pretended, and is thus analogous to the
sham fight already referred to. In all these cases
alike, however, it is the girl only who has to be conquered,
and if the resistance were real it would depend
on herself whether or not she should be captured.
There are other incidents of this forcible marriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
which have more significance than has hitherto been
attached to them. Among the New Zealanders, if the
girl who is being carried off can break away from her
captor and regain her father’s house, the suitor loses
all chance of ever obtaining her in marriage. So, also,
among the Fijians, if a woman does not approve of the
man who has taken her by force to his house, she
leaves him for some one who can protect her. Among
the Fuegians the girl who is not willing to accept her
would-be husband does not wait to be carried off, but
hides herself in the woods, and remains concealed
until he is tired of looking for her. According to
Mongol custom, the bride hides herself with some of
her relations, and the bridegroom has to search for
and find her. Something like the Fuegian custom is
practised by the Aitas, among whom the bride has to
conceal herself in a wood, where the suitor must find
her before sunset.</p>

<p>In these cases the will of the bride-elect is a very
important element, and it is equally so in those cases
where she is captured and carried off only after a
prolonged chase. Thus, with the Kalmucks, according
to Dr. Clarke, the girl gallops away at full speed,
pursued by her suitor, and if she does not wish to
marry him she always effects her escape. An analogous
custom is found among the uncultured tribes of the
Malayan Peninsula. Here, however, the chase is on foot,
and generally round a circle, although sometimes in
the forest, and, as Bourien (quoted by Sir John
Lubbock) says, the pursuer is successful only if he “has
had the good fortune to please the intended bride.”
A similar custom is found among the Koraks of North<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>Eastern
Asia. Here the ceremony takes place within
a large tent containing numerous separate compartments
(<i>pologs</i>), arranged in a continuous circle around
its inner circumference. Mr. Kennan (in his “Tent Life
in Siberia”) gives an amusing and instructive description
of such a ceremony. The women of the encampment,
armed with willow and alder rods, stationed themselves
at the entrances of the pologs, the front curtains
of which were thrown up. Then, at a given signal,
“the bride darted suddenly into the first polog, and
began a rapid flight around the tent, raising the
curtains between the pologs successively, and passing
under. The bridegroom instantly followed in hot
pursuit, but the women who were stationed in each
compartment threw every possible impediment in his
way, tripping up his unwary feet, holding down the
curtains to prevent his passage, and applying the
willow and alder switches unmercifully to a very
susceptible part of his body as he stooped to raise
them.... With undismayed perseverance he pressed
on, stumbling headlong over the outstretched feet of
his female persecutors, and getting constantly entangled
in the ample folds of the reindeer-skin curtains,
which were thrown with the skill of a matador
over his head and eyes. In a moment the bride had
entered the last closed polog near the door, while the
unfortunate bridegroom was still struggling with his
accumulated misfortunes about half way round the
tent. I expected,” says the traveller,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span> “to see him
relax his efforts and give up the contest when the
bride disappeared, and was preparing to protest
strongly on his behalf against the unfairness of the
trial; but, to my surprise, he still struggled on, and
with a final plunge, burst through the curtain of the
last polog, and rejoined his bride,” who had waited for
him there. Mr. Kennan adds that “the intention of
the whole ceremony was evidently to give the woman
an opportunity to marry the man or not, as she chose,
since it was obviously impossible for him to catch her
under such circumstances, unless she voluntarily
waited for him in one of the pologs.”</p>

<p>Judging only from the element of force observable
in what are termed “marriages by capture,” the explanation
of them given by Mr. M’Lennan appears
reasonable. But, although capture may be an incident
of exogamy, the customs under consideration are
really connected with endogamy, in the sense that the
parties to them belong to a common tribe. Moreover,
those customs are wanting in another of the elements
which would be necessary to justify their being
classed as “survivals” of an earlier practice of forcible
exogamy. This pre-supposes the absence of consent on
the part of the relatives of the bride, but the so-called
marriage by capture is nearly always preceded by an
arrangement with them. The only exception among
the various examples of such marriages mentioned by
Sir John Lubbock is that of the inhabitants of Bali,
where the man is said to forcibly carry off his bride to
the woods, and to <i>afterwards</i> effect reconciliation with
her “enraged” friends. It is not improbable, however,
that rage may be simulated in this case as in
others, and that the capture is arranged beforehand
with them. Sir John Lubbock himself explains an
apparent act of lawless violence among the Mandingos<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
as an incident of “marriage by capture,” on the
ground that the bride’s relatives “only laughed at the
farce, and consoled her by saying that she would soon
be reconciled to her situation;” and it appears that
her mother had previously given her consent to the
proceeding. A mere general understanding, if universally
recognised, would indeed be as efficacious as a
special consent, and whether the consent of the parent
has to be obtained previously to overcoming the
opposition of the bride, or whether this has to be
overcome as a condition precedent to the consent
being given, is practically of no importance. We
seem to have an example of the latter in the marriage
customs of the Afghans as described by Elphinstone.
Among this people wives are always purchased, and
the necessity for paying the usual price is not done
away with, although a man is allowed to make sure of
his bride by cutting off a lock of her hair, snatching
away her veil, or throwing a sheet over her, if he
declares at the same time that she is his affianced
wife.</p>

<p>The facts just mentioned lead to the conclusion that
the “capture” which forms the most prominent incident
in the marriage customs under discussion, has a totally
different significance from that which is connected
with exogamy in the sense supposed by Mr. M’Lennan
and Sir John Lubbock. In the latter case force is resorted
to to prevent the possibility of opposition by
the tribe to whom the victim of the violence belongs;
but in the former, as the consent of the woman’s
relatives had already been given, expressly or by implication,
the force must be to overcome the possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
opposition of the woman herself, whether this may
arise from bashfulness or from an actual dislike to the
suitor. We have here an important distinction, and
it points to a state of society where women have acquired
a right to exercise a choice in the matter of marriage.
Before this right could be fully established the suitor
would be allowed to obtain her compliance by force,
if necessary, as with the Greenlanders, among whom,
according to Crantz, the bride, if, after she has been
captured by the old women who negotiated the
marriage, she cannot be persuaded by kind and courteous
treatment, is “compelled by force, nay, sometimes
by blows, to change her state.” But even
among the Greenlanders, if a girl had great repugnance
to her suitor, she could escape marriage by betaking
herself to the mountains. A still more efficacious plan
is the cutting off of her hair, which frees her from all
importunity, as it is accepted as a sure sign that she
has determined never to marry. “Marriage by
capture” has thus relation not to the tribe but to the
individual immediately concerned, and it is based on
her power to withhold her consent to the contract
made between her suitor and her relatives. Among
some uncultured peoples the opposition of the bride-elect
is effectually overcome by force, but it is seldom
that she is not allowed the opportunity of escaping a
marriage which she dislikes. When once it has
become usual for the bride to show a real or simulated
opposition to the proposed marriage, as might easily
be the case among peoples who, although uncultured,
esteem chastity before marriage, it would in course of
time be firmly established as a general custom. Thus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
when a Greenland young woman is asked in marriage
she professes great bashfulness, tears her ringlets, and
runs away. When the show of opposition had become
a matter of etiquette, it would, notwithstanding that
the marriage had been previously arranged, be joined
in by the friends of the bride, who, by a fiction,
is being carried off against her will. Hence the
customs of having a sham fight before the bridegroom
is allowed to gain possession of his prize, and the
placing of impediments in the way of his catching her
in the chase, neither of which has any relation to a
supposed primitive practice of forcible abduction from
a hostile tribe.</p>

<p>It will be said, however, if the relations of the
bride have consented to her marriage, why do they
oppose the carrying into effect of their agreement?
Much light is thrown on this point by the description
given by Colonel Dalton of the customs of the hill-tribes
of Bengal.<a id="FNanchor_249_249" href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> With many of the aboriginal
peoples of India, and with some Sudra castes, one of
the most important ceremonies of marriage is the application
of the <i>Sindur</i> to the forehead of the bride;
this consists in the bridegroom making, usually with
vermilion, a red mark between her eyes. In some
places, however, particularly in Singhbum, among the
Hos, the bridegroom and bride mark each other with
blood, signifying that by marriage they become one.
Colonel Dalton supposes this to be the origin of the
<i>Sindrahan</i>, a custom which is as singular as it is widespread.
With the Oraons, a Dravidian tribe, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
same ceremony is practised, but in secret. A veil is
cast over the bridal pair, who are then covered with
another piece of stuff held by some of their male
relations, while others mount guard, fully armed, as
though to kill any one who might approach to interfere
with the ceremony. In the Singhbum villages
the ceremony is modified, and the engaged couple
drink beer from the same vessel. This signifies that
they form only one body, belong to the same <i>kili</i>—in
other words, that the woman is admitted to the clan
of her husband. Dr. Hunter, in his admirable work
entitled “Annals of Rural Bengal,” says the great event
of the life of a Santal is the union of his “tribe” with
another “tribe” in marriage. No individual can marry
a member of his own clan, and the woman in marrying
abandons the clan of her father, as well as his
gods, to adopt the clan and the gods of her husband.
The ceremony by which the Santals express this separation
is different from that adopted by the Hos. The
husband’s clansmen knot together the garments of
the bridegroom and the bride, after which the
women of the bride’s clan bring lighted charcoal,
crush it with a pestle to indicate the breaking of the
old family tie, and then extinguish it with water to
indicate the definitive separation of the bride from
her own clan. As we have seen, this separation is
effected among the Oraons in the presence of the
members of the two clans, and the sham combat by
which the marriage ceremonies commence is evidently
intended to show that it is indispensable to obtain the
consent, not only of the bride, but also of the family
group to which she belongs, before the ties which bind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
her to the clan can be broken. After offering a pretended
resistance, the clansmen of the bride express
their consent in joining with the relations of the
bridegroom to celebrate the formation of the fresh
family tie.</p>

<p>At first sight, it might be thought that there is
little difference between this explanation of “marriage
by capture” and that given by Sir John Lubbock, but
in reality they differ completely. Sir John Lubbock
supposes a violent capture from another tribe without
any reference to the question of clanship. On the
other hand, in the explanation above proposed, there
is a change in the position of the woman, but it is
brought about by arrangement, the pretended combat
having relation to the rights of the clan, but having
no reference to the wider organisation of the tribe.
The sham-fight is simply a phase of the ceremonies,
destined to show the objection entertained by a family
group to part with one of its members, and, what is
of still greater importance, to give up the interest they
possess in the future offspring of the woman who is to be
cut off from the clan. The essentially pacific character
of the sham-fight is shown by the manner in which, as
described by Colonel Dalton, it is conducted in Gondwana.
Among the Muasi of this district, when the
cavalcade of the bridegroom approaches the house
of the bride, there issues from it a merry troop of
young girls, who are headed by the mother of the
bride, bearing on her head a vessel full of water, surmounted
by a lighted lamp. When the girls come
near the bridegroom’s friends they throw at them balls
of boiled rice, after which they beat a retreat. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
young men pursue them to the door of the house,
which, however, they cannot enter until they have
made presents to its female defenders. The fact that
among nearly all the peoples who have “marriage
by combat,” the children belong to the clan of their
father, confirms the truth of the conclusion I have
sought to establish, that the ceremony in question
has relation to the clan, and not to the bride. Among
the primitive peoples to whom it would be necessary,
on the hypothesis of Sir John Lubbock, to trace the
origin of that curious custom, the children usually
belong to the family group of their mother. The
sham-fight could be introduced when a change has
taken place in the condition of women; but this would
imply a phase of civilisation much more recent than
that of the Australians and other barbarous tribes, to
whose practice of stealing women for wives, which is
mere forcible marriage, has been wrongly traced the
origin of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span> “marriage by capture.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a><br />

<small>DEVELOPMENT OF THE “FAMILY.”</small></h2>


<p>Mr. M’Lennan has remarked, in relation to the
curious customs of capturing women for wives found
among peoples in all parts of the world, that “in
almost all cases the form of capture is the symbol of a
group-act—of a siege, or a pitched battle, or an invasion
of a house by an armed band, while in a few
cases only, and these much disintegrated, it represents
a capture by an individual. On the one side are the
kindred of the husband; on the other the kindred of
the wife.”<a id="FNanchor_250_250" href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> Whatever may be the true explanation
of the origin of exogamy, with which the custom
referred to is connected, there can be no doubt of the
truth of the statement that the wife-capture is now
usually, although it sometimes has relation solely to
the individual, the symbol of a group-act. This may
not be in the sense intended by Mr. M’Lennan, who
looks upon exogamy and polyandry as referable to one
and the same cause, and who regards “all the exogamous
races as having originally been polyandrous.”<a id="FNanchor_251_251" href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">251</a>
The phenomena of wife-capture prove conclusively,
however, that the family group to which the woman
belonged possessed, or thought themselves entitled to,
certain rights over her—rights of which they resisted
the invasion, whether by an individual alone, or by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
a group of persons, or by an individual aided by the
other members of a group. It is important to notice
that the groups in question appear to consist, not of
strangers to each other, or to the man or woman more
immediately concerned, but of persons bound together
by certain ties of blood. This is shown to be so by
the fact that the capture is atoned for by the payment
to the relations of the woman of the marriage-price, if
this has not been agreed on beforehand.<a id="FNanchor_252_252" href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> It is required,
moreover, by the conclusion arrived at by Mr.
M’Lennan, that the tribes among whom the system of
wife-capture prevails are chiefly those whose marriages
are governed by the law of exogamy.<a id="FNanchor_253_253" href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> By
exogamy is meant the practice of marrying out of the
tribe or group of kindred,<a id="FNanchor_254_254" href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> and it is founded on a
prejudice against marriage with kinsfolk.<a id="FNanchor_255_255" href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> There is
some uncertainty as to the nature of M’Lennan’s primitive
group, but, judging from his statement that
“promiscuity, producing uncertainty of fatherhood,
led to the system of kinship through mothers only,”<a id="FNanchor_256_256" href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">256</a>
we may suppose that it consisted of a number of
persons, all of whom, as the result of promiscuity, were
related by blood. The first division into which he
classes uncultured peoples, according to their marriage-rules,
is that where tribes are separate, and all the
members of the tribes are, or feign themselves to be,
of the same blood.<a id="FNanchor_257_257" href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> Mr. Morgan very properly criticises
this definition, which, he says,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span> “might answer for
a description of a gens; but the gens is never found
alone, separate from other gentes. There are several
gentes intermingled by marriage in every tribe composed
of gentes,”<a id="FNanchor_258_258" href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> a fact which would seem to distinguish
the primitive group of M’Lennan, although
consisting of consanguinei, from a gens or clan proper.
Moreover, as Mr. Morgan shows, exogamy has
relation to a rule or law of a gens, considered as “the
unit of organisation of a social system,” and therefore
the gens (of which, as an institution, the rules are prohibition
of intermarriage in the gens, and limitation
of descent in the female line<a id="FNanchor_259_259" href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">259</a>), or rather the family
from which it has sprung, may be regarded as the
earliest social group of which we have any knowledge.</p>

<p>It is of the greatest importance to the discovery of
the nature of the primitive human family to understand
the origin of the gens or clan. As defined by Morgan,
it is “a body of consanguinei descended from the
same common ancestor, distinguished by a gentile
name, and bound together by affinities of blood.”
Mr. Morgan affirms that the gens originated in three
principal conceptions, “the bond of kin, a pure lineage
through descent in the female line, and non-intermarriage
in the gens.”<a id="FNanchor_260_260" href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> The most essential feature is
that of tracing kinship through females only, and the
discovery of the origin of this custom will throw light
on that of the clan-institution itself, and therefore on
the nature of the primitive family.</p>

<p>Mr. M’Lennan finds the origin of kinship through
females only in the uncertainty of paternity, arising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
from the fact that, in primitive times, a woman was not
appropriated to a particular man for his wife, or to
men of one blood as wife.<a id="FNanchor_261_261" href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> The children, although
belonging to the horde, remain attached to their
mothers, and the blood tie observed between them
would, as promiscuity gave place to polyandry of the
ruder kind in which the husbands are strangers in
blood to each other, become developed into the
system of kinship through females.<a id="FNanchor_262_262" href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> An earlier
writer, Bachofen, was so much struck with certain
social phenomena among the ancients, that he believed
women to have, at an early period, been supreme,
not only in the family but in the state. He supposed
that woman revolted against the primitive condition
of promiscuity, and established a system of marriage,
in which the female occupied the first place as the
head of the family, and as the person through whom
kinship was to be traced. This movement, which had
a religious origin, was followed by another resulting
from the development of the idea that the mother
occupied a subordinate position in relation to her
children, of whom the father was the true parent.
Mr. M’Lennan very justly objects to this theory that,
if marriage was, from the beginning, monogamous,
kinship would have been traced through fathers from
the first.<a id="FNanchor_263_263" href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> He adds that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span> “those signs of supremacy
on the woman’s part were the direct consequences (1)
of marriage <i>not</i> being monogamous, or such as to
permit of certainty of fatherhood; and (2) of wives
not as yet living in their husband’s houses, but apart
from them, in the homes of their own mothers.”<a id="FNanchor_264_264" href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">264</a>
The meaning of this is, that the phenomena referred
to by Bachofen were due to the former prevalence of
a system of polyandry, such as still exists among the
Nairs of Southern India. It is very improbable, however,
that kinship through the female only could have
had the origin supposed by Mr. M’Lennan. According
to him one cause of the supremacy of woman
referred to by Bachofen was the fact of wives living
apart from their husbands in the homes of their own
mothers. This custom must, therefore, have preceded
the supremacy of woman, assuming this to have existed,
and the tracing of kinship through females
which gave rise to it. We must believe that originally
women lived alone with their daughters (and their
sons also, until these set up a separate establishment
for themselves, taking with them probably their
favourite sisters, as with the Nairs at the present day),<a id="FNanchor_265_265" href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">265</a>
there being no male head of the family. If, however,
we trace our steps back in thought to the most primitive
period of human existence, we shall see that
such a domestic state as that here supposed cannot
have been the original one. Among savages there is
never that subordination of the man to the woman
which we should have to assume. We cannot suppose
that the primeval group of mankind consisted
of a woman and her children, and if the woman had a
male companion we cannot doubt, judging from what
we know of savage races, that he would be the head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
and chief of the group. The very notion, however, of
the family group having a male as well as a female
head is inconsistent with Mr. M’Lennan’s theory, and
we must trace the origin of female kinship as a system
to a different source from the polyandry to which he
ascribed it.</p>

<p>The idea of a special relationship subsisting between
a woman and her children might no doubt be originated
during the period when the men of a group, “in
the spirit of indifference, indulged in savage promiscuity,”<a id="FNanchor_266_266" href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">266</a>
if such a condition of things ever existed, but
that alone would not be sufficient to establish kinship
through females only. It may be questioned, indeed,
whether there ever was a time when the uncertainty
of paternity, which Mr. M’Lennan’s whole theory requires,
was so pronounced as to prevent kinship
through males being acknowledged. Mr. Morgan
agrees with Mr. M’Lennan so far as to say that, “prior
to the gentile organisation, kinship through females
was undoubtedly superior to kinship through males,
and was doubtless the principal basis upon which the
lower tribal groups were organised.” He affirms truly,
however, that “descent in the female line, which is all
that ‘kinship through females only’ can possibly indicate,”
is only the rule of a gens, and that relationship
through the father is recognised as fully as that through
the mother.<a id="FNanchor_267_267" href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> I have elsewhere, however, given
reasons for believing that this statement does not go
far enough, and that the earliest forms of the classificatory
system of relationships, on which Mr. Morgan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
bases his special theory, require actual kinship, and
not relationship merely, through the male quite as
fully as through the female.</p>

<p>It is surprising that Mr. Morgan says little as to the
origin of descent in the female line. He says: “The
gens, though a very ancient social organisation founded
upon kin, does not include all the descendants of a
common ancestor. It was for the reason that, when
the gens came in, marriage between single pairs was
unknown, and descent through males could not be
traced with certainty. Kindred were linked together
chiefly through the bond of their maternity.”<a id="FNanchor_268_268" href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> We
have here apparently two reasons stated for the establishment
of kinship through females, the absence of
marriages between single pairs, and the uncertainty
of paternity. Both of these conditions are found by
Mr. Morgan to exist in the consanguine family groups
which he supposes to have been formed when promiscuity
ceased. The Polynesian peoples, among whom
he finds traces of the consanguine family, have preserved
the recollection of female kinship, although,
according to Mr. Morgan, the gens is unknown to
them.<a id="FNanchor_269_269" href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> The classificatory system of relationships, the
origin of which he traces to the consanguine family,
can, however, receive a totally different interpretation,
and the existence of that family itself is very doubtful.
Further, the difficulty of tracing descent through
males, which Mr. Morgan supposes, is the result only
of the polyandrous unions his theory requires, and if
they ever really existed they could supply no further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
explanation of the origin of female kinship than the
polyandry of the Nairs. He would have done better
to have sought to connect it, as Mr. M’Lennan does,
with the special relation supposed to exist between a
mother and her child.</p>

<p>Mr. Herbert Spencer shows how this idea may
have arisen. Unlike the other writers I have referred
to, he does not think that promiscuity in the relation
of the sexes ever existed in an unqualified form.<a id="FNanchor_270_270" href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> He
thinks, indeed, that monogamy must have preceded
polygamy, although, owing to the extension of promiscuity,
and the birth of a larger number of children
to <i>unknown</i> fathers than to <i>known</i> fathers, a habit
would arise of thinking of <i>maternal</i> kinship rather
than of <i>paternal</i>, and where paternity was manifest
children would come to be spoken of in the same
way.<a id="FNanchor_271_271" href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> Mr. Spencer adds, that the habit having arisen,
the resulting system of kinship in the female line
would be strengthened by the practice of exogamy.<a id="FNanchor_272_272" href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">272</a>
The defect of this explanation lies in its requiring uncertain
paternity, and I shall show that the system of
female kinship has not arisen from the simple association
in thought of a child with its mother in preference
to its father. It is, moreover, inconsistent with the
fact mentioned by Mr. Spencer himself, that where the
system of female kinship now subsists “male parentage
is habitually known.”<a id="FNanchor_273_273" href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> It is true that he supposes
male kinship to be disregarded, but this conclusion
appears to me not to be supported by sufficient evidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span></p>

<p>That there may have been a short period of barbarism
in which the intercourse between the sexes
was unrestrained by any law of marriage is possible.
Probably, as female chastity before marriage is even
now but slightly regarded among most uncultured
peoples, all sexual alliances were allowable, so long as
the rule as to consanguinity was not infringed, and so
long as no offspring resulted from the alliance,<a id="FNanchor_274_274" href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> where
this was entered into without the consent of parents.
This consent would be necessary in all cases where
such alliances were formed by females for marital purposes,
and the sanction required would be that of the
family head at the early period we are treating of.
Judging from what we observe among modern savages
we cannot doubt that self-interest chiefly would govern
the father in connection with his daughter’s marriage.
He would make certain requisitions as the price of his
consent. Whether the marriage was to be a permanent
or a terminable engagement, the father would
stipulate that his daughter should continue to live with
or near him, and that her children should belong to
the family group of which he is the head. In this case
not only would the children form part of the family to
which their mother belonged, but the husband himself
would become united to it, and would be required to
labour for the benefit of his father-in-law.</p>

<p>A custom still prevalent among the New Zealanders
may be cited in illustration. The Reverend
Richard Taylor says:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span> “Sometimes the father simply
told his intended son-in-law he might come and live
with his daughter; she was thenceforth considered his
wife, he lived with his father-in-law, and became one
of his tribe or <i>hapu</i> to which his wife belonged, and
in case of war was often obliged to fight against his
own relatives.” Mr. Taylor adds, that so common is the
custom of the bridegroom going to live with his wife’s
family, that it frequently occurs; when he refuses to
do so, she will leave him, and go back to her relatives.<a id="FNanchor_275_275" href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">275</a>
When the wife left her father’s house to
reside with her husband he had to purchase the privilege
by giving her father and other relations handsome
presents.<a id="FNanchor_276_276" href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> As among the New Zealanders,
children belonged to their father’s family, the fact of
the wife going to reside among her husband’s relations
meant the loss by her father’s family of the
children. The presents may, therefore, be supposed
to represent the price given by a man for his wife’s
offspring to her relations. This opinion is confirmed
by reference to the marriage customs of a West African
people. Mr. John Kizell, in his correspondence with
Governor Columbine, respecting his negotiations with
the chiefs in the River Sherbro, says:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span> “The young
women are not allowed to have whom they like for a
husband; the choice rests with the parents. If a man
wishes to marry the daughter, he must bring to the
value of twenty or thirty bars to the father and mother;
if they like the man, and the brother likes him, then
they will call all their family together, and tell them,
‘we have a man in the house who wishes to have our
daughter; it is that which makes us call the family
together, that they may know it.’ Then the friends
inquire what he has brought with him? the man tells
them. They then tell him to go and bring a quantity
of palm wine. When he returns, they again call the
family together; they all place themselves on the
ground, and drink the wine, and then give him his
wife. In this case, all the children he has by her are
his, but if he gives nothing for his wife, then the
children will all be taken from him, and will belong to
the woman’s family; he will have nothing to do
with them.”<a id="FNanchor_277_277" href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">277</a></p>

<p>Mr. Taylor says that the ancient and most general
way of obtaining a wife among the New Zealanders was
“for the gentleman to summon his friends, and make
a regular <i>taua</i>, or fight, to carry off the lady by force,
and ofttimes with great violence.”<a id="FNanchor_278_278" href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> A fight also took
place if, when a girl was given in marriage, the friends
of another man thought he had a greater right to her,
or if she eloped with some one contrary to her father’s
or brother’s wish. Even if all were agreeable, “it
was still customary for the bridegroom to go with
a party, and appear to take her away by force, her
friends yielding her up after a feigned struggle; a
few days afterwards, the parents of the lady, with all
her relatives, came upon the bridegroom for his pretended
abduction; after much speaking and apparent
anger, it ended with his making a handsome present
of fine mats, &amp;c., and giving an abundant feast.”<a id="FNanchor_279_279" href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> In
this case the affair ended in the same manner as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
African marriage already referred to, and the idea was
no doubt the same in both—the giving of compensation
to the parents and relations of the woman for the
loss sustained by them through her offspring being
removed from the family group; probably the widespread
custom of pretended forcible marriage was originally
connected with the rights of the woman’s
relations, although sometimes the capture is due to the
desire to obtain for nothing what could otherwise be
acquired only by a purchase fee.</p>

<p>What those rights are may be ascertained from the
information given us by Mr. Morgan as to the privileges
and obligations associated with the membership
of a gens. Among them is an obligation not
to marry in the gens, mutual rights of inheritance of
the property of deceased members, and reciprocal
obligations of help, defence, and redress of injuries.
“The functions and attributes of the gens,” says Morgan,
“gave vitality as well as individuality to the
organisation, and protected the personal rights of its
members,”<a id="FNanchor_280_280" href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> who, as being connected by the ties of
blood relationship, may be regarded as forming an
enlarged family group, or rather a fraternal association
based on kinship.</p>

<p>The gens would, however, form too large a group for
ordinary social purposes, and a smaller group would be
composed of those more immediately allied by blood.
Thus, although theoretically the effects of a deceased
person were distributed among his gentile relations,
yet Morgan admits that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span> “practically they were appropriated
by the nearest of kin.”<a id="FNanchor_281_281" href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> Among the Iroquois,
if a man died leaving a wife and children, his property
was distributed among his gentiles in such a manner
that his sisters and their children, and his maternal
uncles, would receive the most of it. His brothers
might receive a small portion. An analogous rule
prevailed when a woman died. The property remained
in the gens in either case,<a id="FNanchor_282_282" href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> although its division was
restricted to a small number of gentiles. It could
not have been otherwise where the members of the
gens are numerous or widely distributed. The same
principle would apply in relation to rights over
children, who in a low social stage are looked upon
in the light of property. Among the aborigines
of America each gens had personal names that were
used by it alone, and, says Morgan, a gentile name
conferred of itself gentile rights. Now, although
a child was not fully christened until its birth and
name had been announced to the council of the
tribe, its name was selected by its mother with the
concurrence of her nearest relatives. Morgan says
nothing of any right of the gens over the marriage
of its members, and it would seem not to have
any voice in the matter. The formation of the
alliance is usually left to the two individuals more immediately
concerned or to their near relations,<a id="FNanchor_283_283" href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> and
the marriage price belongs to the parents and near kin
of the wife. This, in the absence of the marriage
price, would be the case also with the children born
of her marriage, on the principle that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span> “children are
the wealth of savages.” Reference to the custom of
blood revenge confirms the view that, for certain
purposes, a smaller family group than the gens is
recognised by the peoples having that organisation.
Mr. Morgan thinks the practice of blood revenge
had “its birthplace in the gens,” which was bound to
avenge the murder of one of its members. He says
further that it was “the duty of the gens of the slayer,
and of the slain, to attempt an adjustment of the
crime before proceeding to extremities.” It rested,
however, with the gentile kindred of the slain person
to decide whether a composition for the crime should
be accepted, showing that they were considered the
persons more immediately concerned. The crime of
murder is, as Mr. Morgan says, “as old as human
society, and its punishment by the revenge of kinsmen
is as old as the crime itself.”<a id="FNanchor_284_284" href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> This is hardly consistent
with the preceding statement that the practice of
blood revenge had its birthplace in the gens. It
preceded the development of the gens, and originated
with the smaller family group which, as we
have seen, is more immediately connected with property
and children and the marriage of its female
members. Those who are liable to the obligations of
the law of blood revenge in any particular case must
be identified, and, as they can hardly comprise all the
members of the gens, we must suppose them to be restricted
to the smaller group consisting of near blood
relations. Judging from what we know of the habits
of the Australian aborigines in relation to the <i>lex
talionis</i>, we cannot doubt that the persons subject<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
to retaliation in any particular case are well
defined.</p>

<p>The example of the Polynesian Islanders, who are
said not to have risen to the conception of the gens,
shows that before this was developed, not only was the
<i>lex talionis</i> recognised, but the law of marriage and the
rights of parents over their children were fully established.
These are, therefore, not dependent on the
gens, but are incidental to a simpler group of blood
relations—that on which the gens itself is based.
The idea of “brotherhood” is at the foundation
of all these early social organisations. Mr. Morgan
says, in relation to the Iroquois <i>phratry</i>, that “the
phratry is a brotherhood, as the term imports,
and a natural growth from the organisation into
gentes. It is an organic union or association of two
or more gentes of the same tribe for certain common
objects. These gentes were usually such as had been
formed by the segmentation of an original gens.”<a id="FNanchor_285_285" href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> So
also, a gens forms a fraternal association, as it consists
of “a body of consanguinei descended from the same
common ancestor, distinguished by a gentile name,
and bound together by affinities of blood.”<a id="FNanchor_286_286" href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> If we
trace the ascent until we come to the common ancestor,
we shall have a group of kinsmen who compose the
simplest form of “brotherhood,” that of a parent and
his or her children. Originally this would be a mother
and her daughters, as when the sons formed marriage
associations the daughters only and their children
would be left under the parental roof. It is evident,
therefore, that the primitive family cannot have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
originated within the gens or clan. On the contrary,
the clan was based on the family or group of kinsmen,
without which it could not have existed. Moreover,
it by no means follows that, because the common
ancestor of the members of the gens or clan was a
female, the primitive group of kinsmen had not a
male as well as a female head. Considered as a
“fraternal association,” the father may have been excluded,
but for the purposes of the brotherhood it was
of no importance whether paternity was certain or
uncertain. The result would have been the same in
either case. For other than brotherhood purposes
kinship to the father may have been fully recognised.
The obligations of the <i>lex talionis</i>, the right to property,
and the control of children in marriage, may
have concerned only the kinsmen by the mother’s side,
but those on the father’s side may have been equally
affected by the law of marriage. That such was the
case I have sought to establish elsewhere, as evidenced
by the classificatory system of relationships, and that
view is confirmed by various facts showing that kinship
by the male side is fully recognised among savages.</p>

<p>I have already had occasion to refer to Mr.
M’Lennan’s admission that, if “marriage was, from its
beginning, monogamous, kinship would certainly
(human nature being as it now is) have been traced
through fathers, if not indeed through fathers only,
from the first.”<a id="FNanchor_287_287" href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> Mr. Herbert Spencer, although
apparently thinking that promiscuity in the relations
of the sexes was originally extensive, yet supposes
that it was accompanied by monogamic connections of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
a limited duration. He says that “always the state of
having two wives must be preceded by the state of
having one,” and he looks upon the preference for the
maternal kinship rather than paternal kinship as a
habit, arising from the fact that the former is observed
in all cases, whilst the latter is inferable only in some
cases.<a id="FNanchor_288_288" href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> Mr. Spencer’s admission that where the
system of female kinship now subsists, “male parentage
is habitually known, though disregarded,” greatly
weakens his position, the more so as we are not told
why or when it is disregarded.<a id="FNanchor_289_289" href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> Mr. Morgan goes far
towards supplying an explanation of the fact, although
his theory is defective. He affirms that gentile kin
were superior to other kin only because it conferred
the rights and privileges of a gens, and not because no
other kin was recognised. “Whether in or out of the
gens, a brother was recognised as a brother, a father
as a father, a son as a son, and the same term was
applied in either case without discrimination between
them.”<a id="FNanchor_290_290" href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> Mr. Morgan does not, however, admit of
certainty of paternity, although he states that “they
did not reject kinship through males because of uncertainty,
but gave the benefit of the doubt to a
number of persons—probable fathers being placed in
the category of real fathers, probable brothers in that
of real brothers, and probable sons in that of real
sons.”<a id="FNanchor_291_291" href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> This explanation is plausible but insufficient,
if, as Mr. Morgan says, descent in the female line is
only a rule of a gens.<a id="FNanchor_292_292" href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">292</a> In this case, female descent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
cannot have existed before the gens, and recognition
of kinship through the father may have subsisted prior
to the formation of the gens, together with that of the
relationship between mother and child on which such
descent is founded. This would seem to be required
by the facts mentioned by Mr. Morgan in relation to
the social institutions of the American aborigines. He
says “an Indian tribe is composed of several gentes
developed from two or more, all the members of
which are intermingled by marriage, and all of them
speak the same dialect. To a stranger the tribe is
visible and not the gens.”<a id="FNanchor_293_293" href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">293</a> Originally, therefore, the
tribe consisted of two gentes, that is of the descendants
from two female common ancestors, and, as the
gentes are not visible to a stranger, we must suppose
that the tribe originally represented the male head of
the primitive family group to which the female common
ancestors belonged. On this supposition the primitive
group consisted of a male and two females, the former
being the recognised representative of the group,
although the descent of its members is traced through
the latter. This view is quite consistent with the explanation
I have elsewhere given of the classificatory
system of relationship, which undoubtedly requires the
full recognition for certain purposes of blood relationship
through both the father and the mother.</p>

<p>The conclusion thus arrived at is confirmed by what
we know of the opinions entertained by peoples among
whom the gentile organisation is fully developed.
Carver, as quoted by Sir John Lubbock, states that
among the Hudson’s Bay Indians, children always take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
the name of their mother. The reason they give for
this is, “that as their offspring are indebted to the
father for their souls, the invisible part of their
essence, and to the mother for their corporal and
apparent part, it is more rational that they should be
distinguished by the name of the latter, from whom
they indubitably derive their being, than by that of
the father, to which a doubt might arise whether they
are justly entitled.”<a id="FNanchor_294_294" href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> The reason given by the Hudson’s
Bay Indians why children are called after their
mothers shows that the system of female kinship is
quite consistent with the recognition of kinship through
the male. No doubt the mother is regarded by
savages as having a closer physical relationship to her
child than their father, but it is incredible to suppose
that the latter could ever be looked upon as having
no closer relationship to it than a stranger in blood.
If the mother had several husbands the actual paternity
may not be certain, but, as the father must be one
of several well-ascertained individuals, the paternity
is only rendered less certain, and the child may be regarded
as having several fathers, and claim kinship
through them all. If they are sons of the same father,
that kinship will be with the same persons as though
its mother had but one husband. Under the conditions
I have supposed, however, where a woman
takes, as her husband, a man who lives with her
among her own relations, there would not be any
uncertainty as to paternity, and therefore the stronger
relationship supposed between mother and child must
have originated in the close physical connection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
observed to subsist between them. This does not,
however, explain the origin of clan relationship based
on kinship through females only, which is connected
with the fact of the members of a woman’s clan
possessing certain rights over her and her children.
These rights would not be affected, even if the primitive
custom of the woman continuing to live among
her relations after marriage were departed from.
Before this took place, the system of female kinship
would have become firmly established, and it would be
confirmed, although it could not be originated, by the
idea that, as the wife may not be faithful to her
husband, there is more certainty about maternity than
paternity.</p>

<p>The fact that a man’s heirs are usually his sister’s
children, shows that consanguinity is of great importance
in the eyes of uncultured peoples, and what
has been advanced is quite sufficient to account for
that fact without assuming the existence of a state of
promiscuity in the relations between the sexes. Such
a state is not consistent with the abhorrence which
even savages show to the marriage of persons of near
blood relationship, and it has no support at all in the
observed phenomena of savage life. The <i>punalua</i>
custom of the Polynesian Islanders, which has its counterpart
among the Todas of the Neilgherries, and
traces of which may perhaps be found, on the one
hand, in the fraternal polyandry of the Tibetans, and,
on the other hand, in the sororal polygamy of the
North American aborigines, is neither promiscuous
nor incestuous in the proper sense of these words.
The possession by several brothers of wives in com<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>mon,
who may themselves be sisters, or by several
sisters of husbands in common, who may be brothers,
may, as I have elsewhere suggested, have originally
been due to the feeling that marriage has a spiritual
as well as a physical significance. Punalua was really
an application of the idea of brotherhood to marriage,
and it is not surprising that, among uncultured peoples,
the having wives or husbands in common should be
considered a high mark of friendship.</p>

<p>It is important to notice that among the peoples
who have developed or perfected the gentile institution,
a rule of which is descent in the female line, the
husband is the head of the household, and the wife
little more than a servant, so long as they continue to
live together. It is true, as Lahontan states,<a id="FNanchor_295_295" href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> that the
wife has the same power of divorce as the husband,
but so long as she remains in his cabin she is treated
by him as a drudge and a mere child-bearer. As
women they have some influence in the tribe, but this
is only when they have children to give them dignity.
The Polynesian Islanders not having risen to the conception
of a gens, it is, perhaps, not surprising that
woman is usually regarded by them as an inferior
creature. Her position as a woman is, however,
better than that of a wife, in which capacity she is
cared for as little as among the American aborigines.
Her condition is mitigated only under the influence of
the Areoi Institution, and where she enters into the
punaluan engagement. If it is true, as Mr. Morgan
states, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span> “the Australians rank below the Polynesians,
and far below the American aborigines,” we
cannot wonder that the position of woman among the
Australian aborigines is one of great inferiority. In
fact, among them wives are considered as articles of
property, and not only do they suffer great privations,
but they are most barbarously treated. The last-named
people practice the simplest form of obtaining
wives, that of capture by cunning and personal
violence, but in most of their tribes descent is in the
female line, and the gens or clan is developed more or
less perfectly. And yet the Australian aborigines
possess marriage regulations which seem formed for
the express purpose of preventing the intermarriage of
blood relations, and which fully recognise kinship by
the male line.</p>

<p>A modern French writer of great authority, Fustel
de Coulanges, affirms that the ancient family was constituted
chiefly by religion, the first institution of which
was marriage. The family gives rise to the gens, and
“with its elder and younger branches, its servants and
dependents, formed possibly a very numerous group
of persons.” Such a family, says de Coulanges,
“thanks to the religion which maintained its unity,
thanks to its special privileges which rendered it indivisible,
thanks to the laws of protection which
retained its dependents, formed in time a widespread
society under an hereditary chief.”<a id="FNanchor_296_296" href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> This view of the
primitive family possesses much truth, although it
leaves out of sight one of the most essential features of
the family among uncultured peoples. The same may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
be said in relation to the patriarchal family of Sir
Henry Maine. This writer says that “the earliest tie
which knitted men together in communities was consanguinity
or kinship,” and that “there was no
brotherhood recognised by our savage forefathers,
except actual consanguinity regarded as a fact.”<a id="FNanchor_297_297" href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">297</a> He
adds, that “kinship, as the tie, binding communities
together, tends to be regarded as the same thing with
subjection to a common authority.” The notions of
power and consanguinity are blended, a mixture of
ideas which is seen “in the subjection of the smallest
group, the family, to its patriarchal head.”<a id="FNanchor_298_298" href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> “This
group,” says Sir Henry Maine, “consists of animate and
inanimate property, of wife, children, slaves, land and
goods, all held together by subjection to the despotic
authority of the eldest male of the eldest ascending
line, the father, grandfather, or even more remote
ancestor. The force which binds the group together
is power. A child adopted into the patriarchal family
belongs to it as perfectly as the child naturally born
into it, and a child who severs his connection with it
is lost to it altogether.” The patriarchal family of
Maine thus differs from the ancient family of de Coulanges
in its binding force, which in the one case is
power, and in the other religion, forces which are,
nevertheless, reconciled by the fact that the chief
element in this religion is the ancestral idea which is
at the base of the patriarchal family. This view of
the nature of the ancient family would be complete if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
it provided for the fact, revealed by the study of primitive
institutions as now exhibited among uncultured
peoples, that descent was originally traced by the female
line in preference to the male line. The defect thus
revealed will, however, be removed if it can be shown,
as I have endeavoured to do, that descent through the
male is, for certain purposes, recognised equally with
that through the female. Mr. Herbert Spencer, in his
“Principles of Sociology,” refers,<a id="FNanchor_299_299" href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> as follows, to a suggestion
made by Mr. Fiske, which contains an important
truth bearing on the subject of this paper: “Postulating
the general law that, in proportion as organisms
are complex, they evolve slowly, he infers that the
prolongation of infancy which accompanied development
of the less intelligent primates into the more
intelligent ones, implied greater duration of parental
care. Children, not so soon capable of providing for
themselves, had to be longer nurtured by female parents,
to some extent indeed by male parents, individually or
jointly; and hence resulted a bond holding together
parents and offspring for longer periods, and tending to
initiate the family. That this has been a co-operating
factor in social evolution is very probable.” The bond
thus formed shows its influence even among the lowest
savages, in the natural affection which subsists between
a mother and her children, when these escape the not
unusual fate of infanticide. Natural affection is less
operative with male parents, but there are other feelings
which have relation chiefly to male children which
tend to form an equally binding tie. Mr. Spencer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
remarks that “to the yearnings of natural affection
are added, in early stages of progress, certain motives,
partly personal, partly social, which help to secure
the lives of children, but which, at the same time,
initiate differences of status between children of different
sexes. There is the desire to strengthen the tribe
in war; there is the wish to have a future avenger on
individual enemies; there is the anxiety to leave
behind one who shall perform the funeral rites and
continue oblations at the grave.”<a id="FNanchor_300_300" href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> These motives
must have been influential from the earliest period
at which mankind consisted of more than a few
small and isolated groups, and, therefore, we must
assume that in these groups the male element was
equally as strong as the female element, if, indeed,
they had not a male head. Mr. Spencer remarks further
that those motives, “strengthening as societies
passed through the earlier stages, gradually gave a
certain authority to the claims of male children,
though not to those of females.”<a id="FNanchor_301_301" href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> These ideas are
quite inconsistent with the notion that the family
group ever consisted only of a female ancestor and
her children, or that the woman was originally the
head of, and supreme in, the family. The custom of
tracing descent by the female line shows, however,
that for certain purposes the woman occupied an important
position, although it may, when the practice of
wives going to reside among their husband’s relations
become established, have tended to confirm that of
female infanticide, as the children would be lost to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
mother’s family group. One of the motives referred
to by Mr. Spencer would, after the idea of special
kinship through females had become established, affect
more especially the persons bound together by a
maternal tie. Where the gentile organisation is
established the duty of revenging private injuries is
confined to the other members of the common gens.
The duty of defence against the external enemy
belongs, however, to the <i>tribe</i>, which here undoubtedly
stands in the place of the original family group, in
which both male and female kinship, with their special
duties, was recognised, represented by its male head.
This group we must suppose, therefore, had much in
common with Sir Henry Maine’s patriarchal family.
Under the head of the oldest living male ancestor, it
embraced wife or wives, children and dependents.
The repugnance to marriages between blood relations,
which seems almost instinctive to man, would prevent
such alliances between the members of the group. The
male children, when they reached the age of manhood,
would leave the paternal roof, and obtain wives from
other groups, with which they would become associated
on the principle of adoption, while, on the other
hand, young men from other groups would take their
places as the husbands of the female children. It
would be during this primitive period that the idea of
a special relationship subsisting between a mother and
her children, on which the custom of tracing descent
through the female is founded, would become formed,
as already mentioned. The importance attached to
female kinship would be increased by the development
of a fraternal feeling among the children of the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
mother, a feeling which would be strengthened if, as
would probably not seldom be the case, men, after
some years of cohabitation with their wives, left their
children solely to the mother’s care. Under the
influence of these various ideas and circumstances the
custom of tracing kinship for certain purposes in the
female line would be developed by the time that the
habit had been formed of wives leaving their parents
to reside among their husband’s family. As when
this took place, the custom would be firmly established
under the influence of polygamy, the development
of the gentile organisation would almost necessarily
follow. The primitive idea of kinship through the
father would, however, still remain in full force with
the attributes which originally appertained to it—namely,
the headship in the family group of the eldest
male ancestor, whose authority is practically represented
by the tribe, and the non-intermarriage of those
thus connected.</p>

<small>THE SOCIAL POSITION OF WOMAN AS AFFECTED BY
“CIVILISATION.”</small></h2>


<p>The legend which teaches that the first woman was
formed out of one of the ribs of the first man must
surely be true, seeing that it agrees perfectly with the
position which woman holds among all primitive
peoples!</p>

<p>With few rights, if any, in this life, it is not surprising
that her subordination is continued in the spirit
world, and that if she gains admittance at all into the
native heaven, it is usually under peculiar circumstances.
Thus, the Fijian women are voluntarily
strangled or buried alive at the funerals of their
husbands, from the belief that in <i>their</i> company alone
“can they reach the realms of bliss;” to which is
added the idea that she “who meets her death with
the greatest devotedness will become the favourite
wife in the abode of spirits.” What becomes after
death of the women who do not die with their
husbands is, perhaps, uncertain, but there is reason to
believe that among many uncultured peoples as little
thought is given to the future state of such unfortunates
as to that of animals killed for food. In fact, among
the Papuan tribes, and with many of the natives of
Australia, women are highly prized for cannibal pur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>poses.
Judging from this fact, we shall not expect to
find that, during life, they are much cared for, unless it
be on the principle which sometimes leads cannibals to
fatten their victims before preying on them. This is
not the case, however, with the natives of Australia,
and women among them not only have to endure
many privations, but are most barbarously treated.
Wilkes states that they are considered as articles of
property. Among few peoples is the lot of woman so
cruel as with the aborigines of Australia.</p>

<p>In this respect, however, there is little difference
with any uncultured race. Marriages of affection are
unknown to the Fijians, and women remain faithful to
their husbands from fear rather than from love. “Like
other property,” says Admiral Wilkes, “wives may be
sold at pleasure, and the usual price is a musket.
Those who purchase them may do with them as they
please, even to knocking them on the head.” Thus,
among the Fijians, women are, in the true sense of the
word, “property,” and marriage is a matter of bargain
and sale. This remark is applicable to peoples less
savage than the untamed Papuan. Among the pastoral
tribes of East Africa, and also the black tribes
of Madagascar, women are, if anything, thought less
of than cattle. The Kafirs, indeed, value them <i>in</i>
cattle, and girls pride themselves on the price they
fetch. The condition of the Kafir wife agrees with
the estimation in which she is held. Woman occupies
much the same position with the true Negro tribes,
and even among the North African peoples who have
embraced Mohamedanism the woman is subject absolutely
to the will of her husband. Wives do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
appear to be treated with cruelty, however, and,
according to Mr. Winwood Reade, they often, by
force of a certain public opinion, exercise a peculiar
influence over the men in domestic affairs. Among
the Wahuma of East Africa, women, curiously enough,
are not regarded exactly as property, and their condition
is probably, on the whole, superior to what it is
among the Negro or Kafir tribes.</p>

<p>Women occupy among the American aborigines a
position of, on the whole, greater hardship. They
are generally considered as inferior beings, and their
lives are spent in the lowest and most laborious drudgery.
Throughout both North and South America,
with few exceptions, a wife is treated as the property
of her husband, who will lend her to a friend with as
little compunction as he would a hatchet. Moreover,
as amongst most uncultured peoples, she is always
liable to instant divorce. This arbitrary treatment,
and the hardships which women suffer, have probably
much to do with the prevalence of infanticide, especially
of female children. The condition of woman
among the Eskins appears to be more bearable than
with the true American tribes. This is shown by the
existence between husband and wife of a certain
attachment, which sometimes ripens into real affection;
and yet, according to Sir John Ross, the Eskino
women are considered merely as property or furniture.
It is not far otherwise with the Greenlanders. Crantz
declares that, from their twentieth year, the life of their
women is a mixture of fear, indigence, and lamentation.</p>

<p>Among some of the Polynesian Islanders, and par<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>ticularly
the Samoans, woman is more esteemed than
with others, but usually she is treated in the same
manner as with most uncultured peoples. As shown
by many of their customs, she is looked upon as an
inferior creature. Captain King remarked that at the
Sandwich Islands, when these were first discovered,
less respect was shown to women than at any of the
other Pacific Islands which Captain Cook’s expedition
had visited. All the best kinds of food were
forbidden them. In domestic life they lived almost
entirely by themselves, and although no instance of
positive ill-treatment was actually observed, yet it
was evident that “they had little regard or attention
paid them.”</p>

<p>The facts stated sufficiently establish that, among
primitive peoples, woman is regarded as “property.”
Usually female children are thought little of by their
parents, and they are cared for only as having a certain
exchange value. In the more advanced stage represented
by the pastoral peoples they are more highly
prized, because, although a man may prefer his cattle
to his daughters, these, if successfully reared, will
bring a certain addition to his stock. A curious relic
of this primitive idea of the exchange value of woman
is yet extant in Afghanistan, where crimes are atoned
for by fines estimated, partly in young women, and
partly in money. It is not surprising that the man
who has purchased his wife should look upon her in
the same light as any other chattel which he has acquired,
and this <i>property</i> notion is at the foundation of
most of the social habits of savage life.</p>

<p>It must not be thought that women, even among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
most uncultured peoples, are altogether without influence,
if not over their own condition, yet over the
minds of other. The wars, if such they can be called,
waged by the Australian aborigines, are generally due
to the old women, who incite the men with the most
passionate language to revenge any injury to the tribe,
and they perform the same office among other uncivilised
peoples. It is well-known what influence
over the conduct of such peoples is exercised by the
sorcerers or wizard doctors, and in many parts of both
Africa and America women as well as men exercise
that calling;. It is not often that among the more warlike
races women attain to the position of chief, but such
a state of things is not unknown to the African tribes;
and in Madagascar and the Polynesian Islands woman
is as competent as man to occupy the throne. With
the American tribes who trace descent through
females, women have great influence in the election
of the chiefs.</p>

<p>Nor is woman exactly without <i>rights</i> among uncultured
peoples. At first these relate to the disposition
of her own person before marriage, and the existence
of such a right is implied in the widespread customs
which have been thought to give evidence of the
primitive social phase described as “marriage by
capture.” Mr. Darwin, in his work, “The Descent of
Man,” well points out that among uncultured peoples
girls have more choice in the matter of marriage
than is usually supposed.</p>

<p>It by no means follows that the position of a woman
is, among uncultured peoples, more bearable because
she has managed to marry the man whom she prefers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
Where the marriage has been preceded by actual
attachment, no doubt it usually is so; and in that case,
especially if she has much intelligence, a wife may have
great influence over her husband. It is probable that
polygamy has been an important instrument in improving
the condition of the married woman. With
most uncultured peoples who practise polygamy, a
first wife is the head wife, and all the succeeding ones
are under her control. The former thus occupies a
position of influence in the household; she is less
roughly treated by her husband, and she gradually
acquires certain rights. Mr. Shooter says that, among
the Kafirs, all the cows which a man possesses at the
time of his earliest marriage are regarded as the property
of his first wife, and after the birth of her first
son they are called <i>his</i> cattle. Theoretically, the
husband can neither sell nor dispose of them without
his wife’s consent. Cattle are assigned to each of the
wives whom the husband subsequently takes, and the
wife who furnishes the cattle to purchase and endow
a new wife, is entitled to her services, and calls her
“<i>my</i> wife.” These rights of property are, however,
in reality of very slight value. On the death of the
husband, the women of his household descend to the
son who is entitled to the cattle belonging to each
family division, and if he dies without direct heirs, to
the next male relative, who is nevertheless bound to
provide for them.</p>

<p>It is difficult to conceive that the improvement in
the position of woman witnessed among civilised
peoples, can have been much affected by any change
that could take place in the relation between husband<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
and wife, so long as the latter is treated as mere property.
I am disposed, therefore, to trace that improvement
to another source, and to look upon it as springing
from the maternal relationship. Stern as may be
the treatment experienced by a wife, it is seldom that
a mother is not honoured. This is especially the case
among the African tribes. The same feeling is not
unknown to the Arabs, whose sacred book declares
that “a son gains Paradise at the feet of his mother.”
Inconsistent as it is with our ideas, there can be little
doubt that the curious custom of strangling parents, or
burying them alive, when they have become old and
helpless, is looked upon as a mark of respect and
regard. Wilkes was assured by the missionaries that
the Fijians were kind and affectionate to their parents,
and that they considered the strangling custom as so
great a proof of affection that none but children could
be found to perform it.</p>

<p>The Chinese have preserved the germs of the primitive
idea, according to which woman is a kind of property,
and among them still a wife may be sold, although
only with her own consent, and as a wife and not as a
slave. These restrictions show a great advance, which
is evidenced also by the fact that wives possess equal
rank with their husbands. Moreover, mothers are
allowed a certain degree of influence over their sons,
who are, indeed, obliged at particular seasons to pay
homage to them, the Emperor himself not being
exempt from performing the ceremonies of the <i>kotow</i>
before his mother. Where the filial piety is so strong,
it is not surprising that ancestral-worship extends to
the mother as well as the father, and that the memory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
of women celebrated for their virtues is perpetuated.
Nevertheless, Chinese women are almost absolutely in
the power of their fathers, husbands and sons, to
whom they owe obedience as the representatives of
heaven.</p>

<p>In some of their customs the Romans bore considerable
resemblance to the Chinese. With the former, as
among the latter, the father was absolute within his
family, and originally a woman, as part of her husband’s
<i>familia</i>, could be sold or put to death by him without
interference by the State. This was not so if the wife
was only <i>uxor</i> and retained her own familia, in which
case, however, her children belonged to her husband.
The latter form of marriage, or the custom known as
“breaking the usus of the year,” gradually came to be
the most usual, and it resulted in the emancipation of
women from the control to which they had before
been subjected.</p>

<p>The old Roman, Cato the elder, complained of their
having much power in political matters, and statues
were even then erected in the provinces to Roman
ladies. Unfortunately the emancipation of woman
among the Romans was attended with a license which
had the most deplorable results, both moral and
social.</p>

<p>In Greece the peculiar institutions established by
Lycurgus gave the Spartan women much influence,
and they were even said by the other Greeks to have
brought their husbands under the yoke. On the other
hand, among the Athenians, women were generally
viewed as inferior to men, and wives were treated
rather as household drudges than as companions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
Before marriage girls were kept in strict seclusion, a
habit which, in the middle and higher classes, was
long retained after marriage, wives seeing little even
of their husbands or fathers. It would appear, however,
to have been different during the heroic age,
when the intercourse between husband and wife, says
Mr. Gladstone, was “thoroughly natural, full of
warmth, dignity, reciprocal deference, and substantial,
if not conventional, delicacy.”</p>

<p>It is to the development of the emotion of love that
the full recognition of the true position to which
woman is united must be traced. The parent has
influence because he or she is respected, and love
induces the same feeling in relation to the wife and
woman in general. Thus, at least, it would seem to
be with Eastern peoples, who probably closely agree
in social habits with the ancient Greeks. Among the
Bedouins, in whose manners we may doubtless trace
those of the early Hebrews, women enjoy a considerable
degree of liberty; and hence marriages, although
accompanied by the incidents of wife-purchase, are
often governed by choice, and husbands make real
companions of their wives. The respect paid to them
is so great that, if a homicide can succeed in concealing
his head under the sleeve of a woman and cry
<i>fyardhék</i>, “under thy protection,” his safety is insured.
Pallas mentions an analogous custom as existing
among the Circassians, who also highly esteem
woman. The same may be said of the Afghans,
among whom, although marriage is still a matter of purchase,
love-matches are by no means rare. Wives
often exercise great influence in Afghan households,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
the husband sometimes sinking into a secondary
place.</p>

<p>How far the condition of women has been mitigated
among the Bedouins and other races by Mohammedanism
is an open question. According to the Koran, the Arabs
were accustomed to treat them with great cruelty,
while one of the chief features of Mohammed’s teaching
is the high position accorded to them. In permitting
polygamy, Mohammedan law accommodates itself to the
habits of an earlier stage of social progress, and tends
to perpetuate many of its objectionable features. As
remarked by Lord Kames, polygamy is intimately
connected with the treatment of woman as a slave to
be purchased even in marriage. But, great as are the
evils attending that custom, they depend in great
measure on special circumstances, and they are capable,
as Mohammedan teaching shows, of considerable mitigation.
Probably the practice of polygamy has never,
among a civilised people, been accompanied by more
baneful results than it exhibits in modern Egypt, if
we can accept the testimony of Miss Martineau. This
lady somewhat unjustly remarks that, “if we are to
look for a hell upon earth, it is where polygamy
exists; and that, as polygamy runs riot in Egypt,
Egypt is the lowest depth of this hell.” Polygamy
has not in India so degrading an effect, but, of the six
qualities ascribed to woman by the code of so-called
Gentoo laws, all are bad ones. A really good wife is,
however, so highly esteemed that, if a man forsake
her of his own accord, he is to receive the punishment
of a thief. Perhaps the scarcity of such wives accounts
for the fact mentioned by Bishop Heber, that through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>out
India anything is thought good enough for women,
and that “the roughest words, the poorest garments,
the scantiest alms, the most degrading labour, and the
hardest blows, are generally of their portion.” No
doubt women of the lower castes are here referred to,
and it cannot be supposed that all women are thus
treated. The Abbé Dubois, indeed, affirms that
among the Hindoos the person of a woman is sacred,
and that, however abject her condition, she is always
addressed by every one by the term “mother.” If
we may believe the Abbé, who lived for thirty years
among the natives, the position of Hindoo women is
far superior to what Europeans in general believe. He
says,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span> “To them belong the entire management of their
household, the care of their children, the superintendence
over the menial servants, the distribution of
alms and charities. To them are generally entrusted
the money, jewels, and other valuables of the family;
to them belong the care of procuring provisions and
providing for all expenses; it is they also who are
charged, almost to the exclusion of their husbands,
with the most important affairs of procuring wives for
their sons, and husbands for their daughters, and in
doing it they evince a nicety of attention and wisdom
which are not certainly surpassed in any other country;
while in the management of their domestic business,
they in general show a shrewdness, a savingness, and
a foresight, which would do honour to the best housekeepers
in Europe.... In short, although exposed
outwardly in public to the forbidden frowns of an
austere husband, they cannot be considered in any
other view than as perfect mistresses in the house.
The influence of the Hindoo females on the welfare of
families is so well known, that the successes or misfortunes
of the Hindoo are almost entirely attributed
to the good or bad management of the former; when
a person prospers in the world, it is the custom to say
that he has the happiness to possess an intelligent
wife, and when any one runs to ruin, it is the custom
to say that he has the misfortune to have a bad wife
for a partner.”</p>

<p>Judging from the Abbé’s description, the properties
of a good wife, according to the compiler of the “Book
of Proverbs,” would doubtless meet with the perfect
approval of the Hindoo.</p>

<p>Much as the emancipation of woman is aided by the
development of love between the sexes, she is indebted
to religion for its completion. The description given
by Tacitus of the high honour in which women were
held by the ancient Germans, as being in some sense
holy and as having the gift of prophecy, may be somewhat
exaggerated; but if it is true that the safest
mode of binding that people to their political engagements
was to require as hostages women of noble
birth, we may well believe that their regard for the
female sex had a religious basis. Tacitus adds, that
the care of house and lands and of the family affairs,
was usually committed to the women, while the men
spent their time in feasting, fighting, and sleeping. A
happy commentary this on the question whether
the former is capable of managing her own affairs!
The true position of woman, however, is not that
assigned to her by the ancient Germans, who gave her
a fictitious superiority based on superstition. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
must look to the peoples among whom have flourished
the religions which have permanently influenced the
world, for evidences of the continued improvement of
that position. That which has had the most striking
and lasting effect over the social status of women in
the East is undoubtedly Buddhism. Gautama preached
salvation to all human beings alike, rich and poor,
male and female, and some of his first converts were
women. His teaching went to the root of the prejudice
so powerful in the East, which leads man to
consider woman his inferior,<a id="FNanchor_302_302" href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> and she was at once
raised to a level with him. Hence, in most Buddhist
countries, women are treated as man’s companions,
and not as his slaves. The fact that the former are
allowed to take monastic vows reveals the true source
of female emancipation. It is a recognition of the
capability of woman to attain to the spiritual re-birth,
and, as a consequence, not only to escape from the
material life with its continued evils, but to secure
supreme bliss in another state. The idea of the
spiritual re-birth was at the foundation of the ancient
mysteries, and therefore the admission to them of
woman was a sign of her emancipation. The Zend-Avesta
places men and women on the same footing,
and among the ancient Persians the latter sometimes
occupied even high sacerdotal positions. She was,
moreover, freely admitted to the secret mysteries.
M. Lajard says that the monuments show us women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
not only admitted as neophytes to the celebration of
the mysteries, but performing there sometimes the
part of god-mother (marraine), sometimes that of
priestess and arch-priestess. In these two characters
they assist the initiating priest, and they themselves
preside at the initiation, assisted by a priest or an
arch-priest. The learned French writer concludes,
therefore, that “women among the peoples endowed
with the institution of the mysteries found themselves
thus placed in a condition of equality with man.” That
which had been begun by Buddhism and Mazdaism
was continued by Christianity, which knows no distinction
of sex or position, however much its principles
may from time to time have suffered at the hands of
ignorant or irrational legislators.</p>

<small>SPIRITISM AND MODERN SPIRITUALISM.</small></h2>


<p>Whether what is known as Modern Spiritualism is
true or false, it must have an equal influence on those
who believe it to be true. As being, then, influential
for good or for evil over the lives of thousands of
people, its phenomena are deserving of most careful
attention. For the same reason the analogous phenomena
which have been from time to time observed
among uncultured peoples are also worthy of study.
There is little doubt that nearly everything which has
been done by modern Spiritualists has been performed
from time immemorial by the Shamans, or sorcery
doctors, of the Turanian and allied tribes of the
American and African Continents. The two great
essentials required in either case are the existence of
disembodied spirits and mediums through whom they
can communicate with man. As to the former, it is
doubtful whether there is any race of uncivilised men
who are not firm believers in the existence of spirits
or ghosts. In most cases, and probably in all originally,
these are the spirits of dead men, who are
thought, for a time at least, to wander about the
scenes of their material life, and occasionally to make
their presence known by sounds or by a visible
appearance. So great is the dread of ghosts among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
many of such peoples that they will hardly venture
out of their huts after dark, and when any person is
compelled to do so he invariably carries a light,
although he would not have the slightest difficulty in
finding his way without its aid. Nor is the medium
wanting among the uncivilised races. The most influential
man in the tribe is the sorcery doctor, except
where he is merely a tool in the hands of the chief,
and all his influence is due to his supposed control
over, or, at least, communication with, the denizens of
the spirit world. By their aid he is able to bewitch
his own enemies or those of the persons who seek the
exercise of his natural power, and, on the other hand,
to discover the origin of the disease under which the
sick man is wasting away, and to remove it from him
should the spirits be propitious. The sorcery doctor
of an African tribe, like the Shaman of the Mongol, is
in fact a very oracle through his supposed power of
receiving communications from his immaterial assistants.
Moreover, the means by which he becomes <i>en
rapport</i> with the spirit world are exactly the same as
those employed by the Spiritualist, although the mode
in which the mediumistic condition is induced may
often be very different. Whether arrived at by a
process of mesmerism, or by means of a ceremony
attended with great physical and mental excitement,
or, on the other hand, induced by extreme exhaustion,
or whether it is caused by a kind of intoxication, the
condition required is one of trance. The most simple
mode of attaining it is probably the <i>self-mesmerism</i> of
the Zulus of Natal, an intense concentration and abstraction
of the mind, giving the clairvoyant faculty.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
Canon Calloway states that this process of “inner
divination” is commonly practised by herd boys for
the purpose of finding cattle which have strayed; and
it is even used as a means of escape by those who are
threatened with destruction by a jealous chief.</p>

<p>This clairvoyant power, which is intimately connected
with Spiritualism, is by some peoples ascribed
to spirit communication. Thus, says Scheffer, among
the Laplanders, “When the devil takes a liking to any
person, in his infancy, he haunts him with several
apparitions.... Those who are taken thus a second
time see more visions and gain great knowledge. If
they are seized a third time they arrive to the perfection
of this art, and become so knowing, that without
the drum (the magic drum which answers to the tambourine
of the Mongol and the rattle of the American
Indian), they can see things at the greatest distances,
and are so possessed by the devil, that they see them
even against their will.” Scheffer adds that on his
complaining against a Lapp on account of his drum,
the Lapp brought it to him, “and confessed with tears
that, though he should part with it, and not make
him another, he should have the same visions as formerly
and he instanced the traveller himself, giving
him “a true and particular relation” of whatever had
happened to him in his journey to Lapland.” He complained,
moreover, that “he knew not how to make
use of his eyes, since the things altogether distant
were presented to them.” According to Olaus Magnus,
the Lapland Shaman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span> “falls into an ecstacy and lies
for a short time as if dead; in the meanwhile his companion
takes great care that no gnat or other living
creature touch him, for his soul is carried by some ill
genius into a foreign country, from whence it is brought
back, with a knife, ring, or some other token of his
knowledge of what is done in those parts. After his
rising up he relates all the circumstances belonging to
the business that was inquired after.”</p>

<p>Among the special spiritualistic phenomena which
are recognised among uncultured peoples are spirit-rapping,
spirit-voices, and the cord-unloosening, which,
when first exhibited, created in England so much
astonishment. The last-named phenomenon is not
unknown to the North American Indians, and is
practised by the Greenlanders and by some of the
Siberian Shamans. Thus, among the Samoyedes,
“The Shaman places himself on the ground upon a
dry reindeer skin. Then he allows himself to be
firmly bound, hands and feet. The windows are
closed, and the Shaman calls upon the spirits, when
suddenly a noise is heard in the darkened room.
Voices are heard within and outside the court; but
upon the dry reindeer skin there is regular rhythmical
beating. Bears growl, serpents hiss, and squirrels
seem to jump about. At last the noise ceases. The
windows are opened, and the Shaman enters the court
free and unbound. No one doubts that the spirits
have made the noise and set the Shaman free, and
carried him secretly out of the court.”</p>

<p>We have here the noises, voices, and rope untying
which are so common in spiritualistic <i>séances</i>. These
find a still closer parallel in the curious rites of Greenland
Shamanism, the object of which is to enable the
spirits of the sorcerer to visit heaven or hell as occa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>sion
may require. The historian Crantz thus describes
the ceremony:—</p>

<p>“First the devotee drums awhile, making all manner
of distorted figures, by which he enervates his strength
and works up his enthusiasm. Then he goes to the
entry of the house, and there gets one of his pupils to
tie his head between his legs, and his hands behind
his back with a string; then all the lamps in the house
must be put out and the windows shut up. For no
one must see the interview between him and the
spirit; no one must stir, not so much as to scratch his
head, that the spirit may not be hindered, or rather
that he may not be detected in his knavery....
After he has begun to sing, in which all the rest join
with him, he begins to sigh and puff and foam with
great perturbation and noise, and calls out for his
spirit to come to him, and has often great trouble
before he comes. But if the spirit is still deaf to his
cries, and comes not, his soul flies away to fetch him.
During this dereliction of his soul he is quiet, but, by-and-by,
he returns again with shouts of joy—nay,
with a certain rustling, so that a person who has been
several times present assured me that it was exactly as
if he heard several birds come flying, first over the
house, and afterwards into it. But if the Torngak (or
spirit) comes voluntarily, he remains without in the
entry. There an Angekok (or magician) discourses
with him about anything that the Greenlanders want
to know. Two different voices are distinctly heard,
one as without and one as within. The answer is
always dark and intricate. The hearers interpret the
meaning among themselves, but if they cannot agree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
in the solution, they beg the Torngak to give the
Angekok a more explicit answer. Sometimes another
comes who is not the usual Torngak, in which case
neither the Angekok nor his company understand him....
But if this communication extends still further,
he soars aloft with his Torngak on a long string to the
realm of souls, where he is admitted to a short conference
with the <i>Angekut poglit</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the fat or the
famous wise ones, and learns there the fate of his sick
patient, or even brings him back a new soul. Or else
he descends to the goddess of hell, and sets the enchanted
creatures free. But back he comes presently
again, cries out terribly, and begins to beat his drum;
for, in the meantime, he has found means to disengage
himself from his bonds, at least, by the help of his
scholars, and then, with the air of one quite jaded
with his journey, tells a long story of all that he had
seen and heard. Finally, he tunes up a song, and
goes round, and imparts his benediction to all present
by a touch. Then they light up the lamps, and see
the poor Angekok wan, fatigued, and harassed, so that
he can scarce speak.”</p>

<p>Except that the civilised medium attains to a state
of trance without so much excitement, and does not,
while in that state, take so distant a journey, the
account given by Crantz would almost answer for a
description of a spiritual <i>séance</i>. Most of the occasions
in which the sorcerer is consulted would seem to
be cases of sickness. Illness is usually supposed to be
caused by the agency of spirits, who are annoyed at
something having been done or omitted, and the mission
of the sorcerer is to ascertain whether the sick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
man will live or die, and, if the former, what offering
must be given to propitiate his tormentors. Among the
Zulus, the diviners who eat <i>impepo</i> medicine answer,
in a measure, to the Mongolian Shaman, although
they do not profess to have intercourse with supernatural
agents. This is reserved, apparently, for the
diviners having familiar spirits. These people do
nothing of themselves, sit quite still, and the answers
to the questions put by inquirers are given by voices
at a distance from them. Canon Calloway gives two
curious instances of this mode of divining. In one of
them a young child, belonging to a family from another
kraal which had settled in a village of the Amahlongwa,
was seized with convulsions, and some young
men, its cousins, were sent to consult a woman who
had familiar spirits. They found the woman at home,
but it was not until they had waited a long time that
a small voice proceeding from the roof of the hut
saluted them. They were, of course, much surprised
at being addressed from such a place, but soon a
regular conversation was carried on between them and
the voices, in the course of which the spirits minutely
described the particulars connected with the child’s
illness—a case of convulsions. They then told the
young man that “the disease was not properly convulsions,
but was occasioned by the ancestral spirits,
because they did not approve of them living in their
relative’s kraal, and that, on their return home, they
were to sacrifice a goat (which was particularly
described), and pour its gall over the child, giving it
at the same time Itongo medicine.” This took place
in the day time, and the woman did nothing but occa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>sionally
ask the spirits if they were speaking the truth.
“The young men returned home,” says Calloway,
“sacrificed the goat, poured the gall on the child,
plucked for him Itongo medicine, and gave him the
expressed juice to drink;” and the child had no return
of the convulsions, and is still living. The statement
that, during the interview, the woman did nothing but
occasionally ask the spirits if they were speaking the
truth, is somewhat suspicious, but, whatever the explanation
of the case, one thing seems certain—the
young men had not seen the woman before, as she
lived on the coast, a day and a half’s journey from
them. In the other instance referred to, the ultimate
result was not so favourable, as the sickness was not
removed, but it was attended with an incident by
which we are again reminded of the phenomena of
Spiritualism. The spirits promised to dig up and
bring to the diviner the secret poison which they said
was causing the sickness inquired about. At the time
appointed for the poison to be exhibited the old
people assembled in the diviner’s hut, and, after
arranging themselves in a line at the request of the
spirits, they soon heard, first one thing fall on the
floor, and then another, until at length each person
was told to take up what belonged to him and throw
it into the running stream, when the disease would be
carried away. On examining the things “some found
their beads which they had lost long ago; some found
earth bound up; others found pieces of some old
garment; others shreds of something they had worn;
all found something belonging to them.” In this
case, also, the voices came from above; but among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
some peoples the spirit enters into the body of the
diviner, in like manner as with spiritualistic mediums.
This is so in China, where the spirit of the dead talks
with the living through the male or female medium,
as the case may be—and with all uncultured peoples,
in fact, who look upon their priests, or sorcery doctors,
as oracles.</p>

<p>There are two phenomena known to spiritualists
which we can expect to find only among cultured
peoples. One of these, the so-called spirit writing,
has been practised by the Chinese probably from time
immemorial, and is effected by means of a peculiarly-shaped
pen held by two men and some sand. The
presence of the spirit is shown by a slow movement of
the point of the pen tracing characters in the sand.
After writing a line or two on the sand the pen ceases
to move, and the characters are transferred to paper.
After this, if the response is unfinished, another line
is written, and so on, until the pen entirely ceases its
motion, which signifies that the spirit of the divinity
has taken its departure from the pen. Like the spirit
drawings of modern mediums, the meaning of the
figures thus obtained is often very difficult to make
out. The other phenomenon is the rising and floating
in the air, in which Mr. Home was so great an adept.
This in all ages has been the privilege of the saints,
Asiatic or European, Buddhist or Christian, who
have attained to a state of spiritual ecstacy.</p>

<p>At the beginning of this Essay it was said that, so
long as the phenomena of Spiritualism are believed to
be true, they have equal influence, whether true or
false. On the other hand, it must not be thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
that, because they are accepted as true by uncultured
people, therefore they <i>are</i> false, as being merely due
to fraud or superstition. To those even who believe
in a spirit world, the question of spirit action in connection
with the phenomena is one of the utmost
difficulty; and a possible explanation may be suggested
of the most remarkable of them, based on
physical facts recorded by spiritualists themselves,
without the necessity of seeking spirit agency. It
has been noticed that the faces which appear at the
openings of the cabinet in which the Spiritualist
mediums sit are usually at first, if not ultimately, much
like the mediums themselves, and yet it seems to be
absolutely impossible, considering how they are
secured, that such could be the case. It may, however,
only be impossible under the <i>ordinary</i> conditions
of physical life. If certain phenomena said
to have been observed were so in reality, the apparent
difficulty is removed. It has frequently been noticed
that colouring matter placed on a spirit hand has
afterwards been found on the hand or body of the
medium. This has been established by experiments
tried for the purpose. Further, it is stated that occasionally,
when a light has been suddenly struck, a
long hand and arm have been seen swiftly drawn in
towards the medium. Moreover, the body itself of
the medium, absurd as such a thing appears to be, has
been seen to elongate, if we are to believe the statement
of Mrs. Corner, made through the <i>Spiritualist</i>,
in connection with the medium, Miss Cook. The
familiar spirit of this medium has been seen rising from
her body, and some Spiritualists believe that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
spirits usually, if not always, rise out of their mediums.
In the instance just mentioned the spirit was said to
have been visibly connected with the medium by
cloudy, faintly luminous threads.</p>

<p>If we accept these statements as true, most of the
phenomena of Spiritualism are explainable without
reference to the agency of spirits. They would show
that the human body must contain within itself an
inner form, be it material or immaterial, which, under
proper conditions, is able to disengage itself either
wholly or partly from its outer covering. The spirit
hands which appear, and which are able to move
heavy weights and convey them long distances
through the air, would really be those of the medium.
The faces and full length figures which show themselves,
holding conversations, and allowing themselves
to be touched, and even permitting their robes to be
cut, become the faces and figures of the mediums. This
view receives confirmation from the Spiritualist standpoint,
from the fact (if such it be) that the “doubles”
of well-known mediums have sometimes been recognised
in the presence of the originals, and (seeing
that Spiritualists believe the body to be capable of
elongation) it is not inconsistent with what has been
observed that the spirit figure is sometimes much
taller than the medium. It is consistent, moreover,
with the facts, that the distance from the medium
within which the spirit figures can appear is limited,
and that if the hands of the medium be held closely
<i>from the first</i>, many of the manifestations cannot be
produced. This point has been insisted upon as
proof of imposture; but assuming, for the sake of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
argument, the truth of what is said as to the human
“double,” it simply shows how intimately associated
are the external covering and the inner form which
has to become disengaged to show itself.</p>

<p>The more the subject is studied the more evident
does it become that most of the phenomena in
question are dependent solely on the medium himself.
The evidence of Mrs. Everitt, given in the <i>Spiritualist</i>,
seems to furnish the key to all such phenomena as
that of the appearance of “Katie King.” Mrs.
Everitt stated that, when entranced, she had seen her
own body<a id="FNanchor_303_303" href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> in a chair, and been struck with the
circumstance; and she added, that in the case of such a
temporary separation between the spirit and the body,
these are united by a magnetic cord. We have only
to imagine that when Mrs. Everitt was entranced, her
spirit became visible to the persons at the <i>séance</i>, and
we should have the exact phenomenon produced at
Miss Cook’s <i>séances</i>. Moreover, the fact of the so-called
spirit and the body of the medium being visible
at the same time, which has been thought to prove that
they are perfectly distinct persons, thus loses its
apparent significance. If Mrs. Everitt’s spirit and the
body which she saw belonged to the same person, so
may the spirit seen at Miss Cook’s <i>séances</i> belong to Miss
Cook herself; an inference which is supported by the
fact, that when the former disappeared, it was absorbed
into Miss Cook’s own organism. The magnetic
cord which Mrs. Everitt referred to as uniting the
spirit and body while these are temporarily separated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
exists also, so far as can be judged from the published
reports of the <i>séances</i> of Katie and Miss Cook.</p>

<p>A remarkable confirmation of the above theory<a id="FNanchor_304_304" href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">304</a> is
given in a recent work by Col. Olcott, who, in 1874,
at the Eddy homestead, in Vermont, U.S., witnessed
the appearance of upwards of five hundred materialised
figures, of the reality of which he was convinced,
although they could be accounted for as proceeding
from the medium himself, and not as due to the
agency of departed spirits.<a id="FNanchor_305_305" href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">305</a></p>

<p>While offering the above explanation of many of
the most important phenomena vouched for by the
advocates of Spiritualism, it is simply to show that
such phenomena, according to the evidence of Spiritualists
themselves, do not require the intervention
of spirit agency, although this has an important bearing
on the past history of mankind. Spiritism has a
marvellous influence over the mind of uncultured man,
and it has retained its influence almost unimpaired
through most of the phases of human progress. A
late French writer, after stating that superstition was
supreme in the Roman Empire at the commencement
of the Christian era, declares that magic was universally
practised, with the object of acquiring, by means
of “demons”—the spirits of the dead—power to
benefit the person using it, or to injure those who
were obnoxious to him. It is thus evident that the
phenomena to which the modern term “Spiritualism”
has been applied are of great interest to the Anthro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>pologist,
and, indeed, of the utmost importance for a
right understanding of some of the chief problems
with which he has to deal. They constitute an
element in the life-history of past generations which
cannot be left out of consideration when their mental
and moral condition are being studied; and modern
<i>Spiritualism</i> may, therefore, be studied with great
advantage as a key to what is more properly called
<i>Spiritism</i>. Not that the former can be considered as
an instance of “survival,” in the proper sense of this
phrase. Apart from such isolated instances as that of
Swedenborg, Spiritualism is of quite recent introduction,
and it appears to have had no direct connection
with its earlier prototype. It is worthy of note, however,
that it sprang up among the people who have
long been in contact with primitive tribes, over whom
Spiritism has always had a powerful influence. It is
possible that intermixture of Indian blood with that
of the European settlers in North America may have
had something to do with the appearance of Spiritualism,
which would thus be an example of intellectual
reversion, analogous to the physical divergence
to the Indian type which has by some writers been
ascribed to the descendants of those settlers. Or the
former may be merely a resemblance, instead of a
reversion, dependent on the change in the physical
organism. In either case, it is somewhat remarkable
that many of the so-called “spirits,” which operate
through Spiritualist mediums, claim to have had an
American (Indian) origin.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a><br />

<small>TOTEMS AND TOTEMISM.</small></h2>


<p>After treating of the nature of totems, I propose
to explain the object of totemism as a system, and to
show its origin. I am not aware that this has yet
been attempted in an adequate manner, although the
subject has been referred to, as I shall have occasion
to show, by several writers of authority. The late
Dr. J. F. M’Lennan, who first dealt with the subject
of totemism, which indeed he made his own, did not
profess to explain its origin, notwithstanding certain
remarks bearing on this question made in the course
of his inquiries.</p>

<p>The first point to be considered is the nature of a
“totem,” and this is shown by the meaning of the name
itself. The word is taken from the language of the
Ojibwas, a tribe of the widespread Algonkin stock,
living near Lake Superior, in North America. It
signifies the symbol or device of a gens or tribal division,
that by which it is distinguished from all other
such divisions. The kind of objects used as totems by
the aborigines of North America may be seen from
the names of the gentes into which the Ojibwa tribe
is divided. These are twenty-three in number, and
the totemic devices belonging to them comprise nine
quadrupeds (the chief of which are the Wolf, the
Bear, the Beaver, and the Turtle), eight birds, five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
fishes, and one reptile, the snake. There are numerous
other totems among the American tribes, and
they are not taken from the animal kingdom only.
Thus, there are gentes with vegetable totems, such as
<i>Corn, Potatoe, Tobacco-Plant, and Reed-Grass</i>. Natural
objects, such as <i>Sun</i>, <i>Earth</i>, <i>Sand</i>, <i>Salt</i>, <i>Sea</i>, <i>Snow</i>,
<i>Ice</i>, <i>Water</i>, and <i>Rain</i>, give names to other tribal divisions.
Among natural phenomena, <i>Thunder</i> is widely
spread as the name of a gens, while <i>Wind</i> is used
among the Creek Indians; and the Omahas have a
name meaning <i>Many Seasons</i>. <i>Medicine</i>, <i>Tent</i>, <i>Lodge</i>,
<i>Bonnet</i>, <i>Leggings</i>, and <i>Knife</i>, have given titles to other
gentes, and so also has <i>colour</i>. Thus, we have <i>Black</i>
and <i>Red</i> Omahas, and <i>Blue</i> and <i>Red-Paint</i> Cherokees.
Names denoting qualities have been taken by some
gentes, such as <i>Beloved People</i> of the Choctas; <i>Never
Laugh</i>, <i>Starving</i>, <i>Half-Dead</i>, <i>Meat</i>, <i>Fish-Eaters</i>, and
<i>Conjurers</i> of the Blackfeet; and the <i>Non-Chewing</i> of
the Delawares. How some of those ideas could be
represented pictorially as totems is not very apparent,
and Mr. Lewis Morgan very properly suggests, in
relation to some of the terms, that nicknames for
gentes may have superseded the original names; to
which may be added that probably many of the
totems are of comparatively modern origin.</p>

<p>The natives of Australia make the same use of
totems as the Americans. The former have divisions
of the tribe answering to the gentes of the latter, distinguished
by a common device or totem; and the
Australian totemic divisions are usually, like the
American gentes, named after animals. Thus, the
Kamilaroi tribes have <i>Kangaroo</i>, <i>Opossum</i>, <i>Iguana</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
<i>Emu</i>, <i>Bandicoot</i>, and <i>Blacksnake</i> totems. <i>Eaglehawk</i>
and <i>Crow</i> are widely spread throughout Eastern
Australia as names of Class divisions. Totems taken
from the vegetable kingdom appear to be uncommon,
as only two are mentioned in the Rev. Lorimer
Fison’s work on the Kamilaroi. The Rev. George
Taplin names two others among the totems of the
South Australian tribes, each of which has a “tutelary
genius,” or “tribal symbol,” in the shape of some
bird, beast, fish, reptile, insect, or substance. The
divisions of a tribe in Western Victoria take their
totems from natural features, such as <i>Water</i>, <i>Mountain</i>,
<i>Swamp</i>, and <i>River</i>, and in North-Western Victoria
the totemic divisions include <i>Hot-Wind</i> and <i>Belonging-to-the-Sun</i>.</p>

<p>Although no such developed totemic system as that
in use by the natives of Australia and North America
is known now to exist elsewhere, yet there are traces
of the use of totems by many other peoples. Thus,
among the Bechuanas of South Africa,<a id="FNanchor_306_306" href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> each tribe
takes its name from an animal or plant, and its members
are known as “men of the crocodile,” “men
of the fish,” “men of the monkey,” “men of the
buffalo,” “men of the wild vine,” &amp;c. The head
of the family, which holds the first rank in the
tribe, receives the title of “great man” of the
animal whose name it bears, and no one belonging
to the tribe will eat the flesh, or clothe himself
with the skin, of its protecting animal, who is regarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
as the father of the tribe. Many of the Arab tribes
take their names from animals, such as the Lion,
the Panther, the Wolf, the Bear, the Dog, the Fox,
the Hyena, the Sheep, and many others.<a id="FNanchor_307_307" href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> Professor
Robertson Smith, who has endeavoured to establish
the existence of totemism among the early Arabs,
states that the totem animal was not used as ordinary
food by those connected with it. Again, some of the
Kolarian tribes of India are divided into clans named
after animals, and we find the Heron, Hawk, Crow,
and Eel clans among the Oraon and Munda tribes of
Chota-Nagpur.</p>

<p>A totem origin may probably be ascribed to the
animal ancestry claimed by a chief or his tribe. Thus,
it is said by M. M. Valikhanof<a id="FNanchor_308_308" href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">308</a> that “a characteristic
feature in Central Asiatic traditions is the derivation
of their origin from some animal.” The Kastsché, or
Tele people, are said to have sprung from the marriage
of a wolf and a beautiful Hun Princess. The Tugas
professed to be descended from a she-wolf, and the
Tufans, or Tibetans, from a dog. The Chinese
affirmed, moreover, that Balaché, the hereditary chief
of the Mongol Khans, was the son of a blue wolf<a id="FNanchor_309_309" href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> and
a white hind. Traces of the use of totems by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
Chinese themselves are not wanting. Their expression
for the people is <i>Pih-sing</i>, meaning “the hundred
family names.” As a fact, there are about four
hundred such names in China, and the intermarriage
of persons having the same family name is absolutely
forbidden. The importance of this prohibition will
be apparent when we come to consider the incidents
of totemism. Mr. Robert Hart states<a id="FNanchor_310_310" href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> that some of
the Chinese surnames have reference to animals, fruits,
metals, natural objects, &amp;c., such as Horse, Sheep,
Ox,<a id="FNanchor_311_311" href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> Fish, Bird, Flower, Rice, River, Water, Cloud,
Gold, &amp;c., &amp;c. He adds, “In some parts of the
country large villages are met with, in each of which
there exists but one family name; thus, in one district
will be found, say, three villages, each containing two
or three thousand people, the one of the ‘Horse,’ the
second of the ‘Sheep,’ and the third of the ‘Ox’
family name.” According to the rule that a man
cannot marry a woman of his own family name,
a ‘Horse’ cannot marry a ‘Horse,’ but must
marry a ‘Sheep,’ or an ‘Ox,’ and we may suppose
that these animals were originally the totems or devices
of particular family groups; in like manner, as the
Wolf, the Bear, and the Beaver are, among the
American aborigines, totems of the groups of kin to
which the term gens is applied.</p>

<p>The former use of totems may probably be assumed
also when animal names are applied, not to tribal divi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>sions,
but to the tribes themselves, as we have seen is
the case with the Arabs. Thus, when the great Hindu
Epic,<a id="FNanchor_312_312" href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">312</a> in describing the adventures of Arjuna, one of
the Pandavan Princes, says that the Nagas or Serpents
were defeated with the aid of Peacocks, we must
understand that a people known as Peacocks, from
their totemic device, defeated a people whose badge
was a serpent. The Peacock was indeed the heraldic
device of the Tambouk Kings of Orissa. Probably
the existence of the <i>Singhs</i> or Lions, the warrior
caste of the tribes of North-Western India, may be
accounted for in the same way. Dr. M’Lennan<a id="FNanchor_313_313" href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> refers
to numerous facts to prove that many animals, among
others the Serpent, the Horse, the Bull, the Lion, the
Bear, the Dog, and the Goat gave names to ancient
tribes, who used the animals after whom they were
called as badges. He goes further than this, and
supposes that all the ancient nations passed through
a totem stage, in which they had animals and plants
for gods. This question, however, we shall have
occasion to refer to later on.</p>

<p>The nature of totems having been shown, the object
of totemism as a system has now to be explained.
The Rev. George Taplin remarks that each Narrinyeri
tribe is regarded as a family, every member of which
is a blood relation, and the totem borne by the
Australian tribe, or rather tribal division, is thus the
symbol of a family group, in like manner as the
American totem is the device of a gens. The first
question asked of a stranger by the Dieyerie tribe of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
Cooper’s Creek, in Central Australia, is “Of what
family (murdoo) are you?” Each murdoo is distinguished
by a special name, being that of some
object which, according to a tribal legend, may be
animate or inanimate, such as a dog, mouse, emu,
iguana, rain, &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_314_314" href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">314</a> It is evident that the Australian
totemic device is equivalent to a family name, a name
which belongs to all the members of a particular
group, and which cannot be held by any person not
belonging by birth or adoption to that group, so that
it is aptly termed by the Rev. Lorimer Fison<a id="FNanchor_315_315" href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> a
“badge of fraternity.” This badge answers to the
“device of a gens,” as the token of the American
tribes is defined, and its possession by any person is
proof that he belongs to a particular gens or tribal
division, and that he is entitled or subject to all the
rights, privileges, and obligations of its members.
Schoolcraft very properly terms the gens the totemic
institution, and as the rights, privileges, and obligations
of the gens are attached to the totem, a consideration
of them will throw much light on the
subject of this paper.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Morgan,<a id="FNanchor_316_316" href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> the gens came into
being upon three principal conceptions, the bond of
kin, a pure lineage through descent in the female line,
and non-intermarriage in the gens. Leaving out of
view for the present the question of descent, the other
conceptions give rise to obligations of great importance.
The bond of kin assumes the positive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
obligation of mutual help, defence, and redress of
injuries among the members of the gens; while the
third conception implies the negative obligation which
prevents the intermarriage of persons belonging to a
common totem. The negative obligation is, however,
no less than the positive obligation, based on the conception
of kinship, and the totem device of the gens
is, therefore, well described as the badge of a fraternal
group. The obligation of mutual aid and defence
implies the co-relative duty of doing nothing to injure
a fellow member of the gens, in accordance with
which all individuals of the same totem must treat
each other as brethren. This applies not only to
human beings, but also to the totem objects, although
these may be killed and eaten by persons not belonging
to the fraternal group, by which they are
regarded as sacred. Sir George Grey says,<a id="FNanchor_317_317" href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> in relation
to the <i>kobongs</i> or totems of the Western Australians,
“a certain mysterious connection exists between the
family and its kobong, so that a member of the
family will never kill an animal of the species to
which his kobong belongs, should he find it asleep;
indeed, he always kills it reluctantly, and never without
affording it a chance of escape.” He adds: “This
arises from the family belief, that some one individual
of the species is their nearest friend, to kill whom
would be a great crime, and to be carefully avoided.
Similarly a native who has a vegetable for his kobong
may not gather it under certain circumstances, and at
a particular period of the year.” So, also, the abo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>rigines
of North America will not hunt, kill, or eat
any animal of the form of their own totem.</p>

<p>Where, therefore, we find particular animals forbidden
for food to a class of individuals we may
assume that such animals have a totemic character.
Thus, Bosman relates<a id="FNanchor_318_318" href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">318</a> that, on the Gold Coast of
Guinea, each person “is forbidden the eating of one
sort of flesh or other; one eats no mutton, another no
goats’-flesh, beef, swines’-flesh, wild fowl, &amp;c.” He
points out that this restraint is not for a limited
time, but for the whole of life; and as a son never
eats what his father is restrained from, or a daughter
that which her mother cannot eat, the forbidden
object partakes of the nature of a totem. It is
doubtful whether the Islanders of the Pacific ever
possessed systematic totemism, although traces of the
use of totems may, perhaps, be found in the names
taken from plants met with in some of the islands,
and even in the word “Samoa,” which is said by
the Rev. Wyatt Gill<a id="FNanchor_319_319" href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> to mean “the family or clan
of the Moa,” the Polynesian term for <i>fowl</i>. The
Samoans entertained ideas as to particular animals,
such as the eel, the shark, the turtle, the dog, the
owl, and the lizard, similar to the notions associated
with the totems of other peoples. They supposed
those animals to be incarnations of household deities,
and no man dare injure or eat the animal which was
the incarnation of his own god, although he could
eat freely of the incarnation of another man’s god.<a id="FNanchor_320_320" href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">320</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span></p>

<p>Notions of the same kind were prevalent throughout
the islands of the Pacific.<a id="FNanchor_321_321" href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> Thus, the Fijians
supposed every man to be under the protection of a
special god, who resided in or was symbolised by
some animal, or other natural object, such as a rat, a
shark, a hawk, a tree, &amp;c. No one would eat the
particular animal associated with his own god;<a id="FNanchor_322_322" href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">322</a>
which explains the fact that cannibalism was not
quite universal among the Fijians, as some gods were
believed to reside in human bodies. The heathen
Fijians allow souls not only to all mankind, but to
animals and plants, and even to houses, canoes, and
all mechanical contrivances. As soon as their parents
die they are enrolled among the family gods, whose
protecting care is firmly believed in.<a id="FNanchor_323_323" href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> It is very
probable that these gods, who answer to the household
deities of the Samoans, are regarded as being
incarnate in the sacred animals, &amp;c., of the tribe,
towards whom, as being re-embodiments of deceased
ancestors, they necessarily stand in a fraternal relation.</p>

<p>These ideas show a close connection between
animal-worship and ancestor-worship, and they have
an important bearing on the origin of totemism.
We have seen that the obligations of the totemic
institution are based on the conception of kinship.
This is also essential to ancestor-worship, which, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
totemism, rests on the obligation of mutual aid and
protection. The worshippers make the offerings and
perform the rites required by their deceased ancestors,
who in return give their protection and assistance
to their descendants. This mutual obligation is associated
with the superstitious regard for certain animals
and other objects. The venerated animals are not
killed or eaten by those who are connected with
them by superstitious ties, and they are supposed, on
their part, to act as protectors to their human allies,
by whom they are viewed as guardian spirits. Catlin,
the American traveller, gives a vivid description of
the mode in which the Indian acquires such a
guardian. He states<a id="FNanchor_324_324" href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">324</a> that every Indian must “make
mystery,” that is, obtain the protection of some
mysterious power which is supposed to be connected
with what is known as the mystery bag. When a
boy has attained the age of 14 or 15 years, he absents
himself for several days from his father’s lodge,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
“lying on the ground in some remote or secluded
spot, crying to the Great Spirit, and fasting the whole
time. During this period of peril and abstinence,
when he falls asleep, the first animal, bird, or reptile
of which he dreams (or pretends to have dreamed,
perhaps), he considers the Great Spirit has designated
for his mysterious protector through life. He then
returns home to his father’s lodge, and relates his
success, and after allaying his thirst and satisfying his
appetite, he sallies forth with weapons or traps until
he can procure the animal or bird, the skin of which
he preserves entire, and ornaments it according to his
own fancy, and carries it with him through life, for
good luck (as he calls it): as his strength in battle,
and in death his guardian spirit, that is buried with
him, and which is to conduct him safe to the beautiful
hunting grounds, which he contemplates in the world
to come.” In California it was thought that the
Great Spirit sent, in a vision, to every child of seven
years of age, the appearance of some animal to be its
protector or guardian. The African fetish superstition
is of much the same character, as the fetish
object is worshipped solely that it may give the protecting
aid which the Indian expects from his animal
guardian. Mr. Cruickshank says,<a id="FNanchor_325_325" href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> in relation to the
natives of the Gold Coast of Western Africa, that
they believe “the Supreme Being has bestowed upon
a variety of objects, animate and inanimate, the
attributes of Deity, and that he directs every individual
man in his choice of his object of worship....
It may be a block, a stone, a tree, a river, a lake, a
mountain, a snake, an alligator, a bundle of rags, or
whatever the extravagent imagination of the idolater
may pitch upon.” Here, although the nature of the
protecting influence is apparently different from that
which the Americans are supposed to obtain, it is in
reality the same. In either case it is a guardian
spirit, whether it is called a “mystery” animal or an
object having the attributes of Deity.</p>

<p>Dr. M’Lennan saw a necessary connection between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
totemism and animal-worship, and he affirms<a id="FNanchor_326_326" href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> that
the ancient nations passed, in pre-historic times,
“through the totem stage, having animals and
plants, and the heavenly bodies conceived as animals,
for gods before the anthropomorphic gods appeared.”
By <i>totem</i>, Dr. M’Lennan evidently understood merely
the animal or plant friend or protector of the family
or tribe, and if it had any reference to <i>soul</i> or <i>spirit</i>,
it is the soul or spirit of the animal or plant. He
speaks<a id="FNanchor_327_327" href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> of men “believing themselves to be of the
serpent-breed derived from serpent-ancestors,” and
so of other animals. He does not see in the totem
any reference to the actual progenitor of the
family, and he could hardly do so in accordance
with his view of the mental condition of men
in the totem stage, where “natural phenomena
are ascribable to the presence in animals, plants, and
things, and in the forces of nature, of such spirits
prompting to action as men are conscious they themselves
possess.” Professor Robertson Smith accepts,
in his work on the early Arabs,<a id="FNanchor_328_328" href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">328</a> Dr. M’Lennan’s
views on the subject of totemism and animal-worship,
and gives as one of the three points which supply
complete proof of early totemism in any race, “the
prevalence of the conception that the members of the
stock are of the blood of the eponym animal, or are
sprung from a plant of the species chosen as totem.”
When Prof. Smith comes to consider this point, however,
it appears that among the Arabs certain animals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
were not eaten because “they were thought to be
men in another guise,” that is, they were not merely
animals but were men in disguise.<a id="FNanchor_329_329" href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">329</a> This is very different
from the animistic theory, which makes men trace
their descent from animals or plants, although these
may be supposed to have the same kind of spirits as
their human descendants; but it is consistent with
the doctrine of transmigration to which we shall have
soon to refer.</p>

<p>Dr. M’Lennan’s hypothesis may be tested by what
we know of the animal-worship of ancient Egypt,
where some animals were universally worshipped,
while others were regarded with veneration only in
particular districts, of which they were the guardians,
and by whose inhabitants they were carefully protected.
We have here the operation of the idea of a
special relation subsisting between certain persons and
particular animals, such as we have seen to exist in
connection with totemism; and that relationship must,
according to Dr. M’Lennan’s hypothesis that animal and
plant gods were the earliest to be worshipped, have
depended on the animal descent of those persons. This
explanation may appear to find some support in M. Maspero’s
statement,<a id="FNanchor_330_330" href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">330</a> that all the sacred animals of Egypt
were at first adored in their animal character, and that
afterwards they were identified with the gods of whom
ultimately they became the incarnation or living tabernacle.
It is very improbable, however, that the gods
would be identified with animals, unless such animals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
were already regarded as divine, or as connected with
the peoples of whom they were the guardians—by
virtue of such a special relationship as is thought by
the Pacific Islanders to subsist between certain persons
and the sacred animals in which their ancestors are
incarnated. As a fact, the worship of animals was
established in ancient Egypt by a king of the
second dynasty.<a id="FNanchor_331_331" href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">331</a> Moreover, it has been shown by
M. Pierret that the Egyptian religion was essentially
monotheistic, the different gods represented on the
monuments being merely symbols. “Their very form,”
says that writer, “proves that we cannot see in them
real beings. A god represented with the head of a
bird or of a quadruped can have only an allegorical
character, in like manner as the lion with a human
head called a sphinx has never passed for a real animal.
It is only a question of hieroglyphics. The various
personages of the Pantheon represent the functions of
the Supreme God, of the only and hidden God, who
preserves His identity and the fulness of His attributes
under each of His forms.” Dupuis, in his History of
Religions,<a id="FNanchor_332_332" href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">332</a> refers to the ancient opinion that the division
of Egypt into thirty-six nomes or provinces was in imitation
of the thirty-six decans into which the Zodiac was
divided, each of which had its protector. The heavenly
guardians became the protecting deities of the Egyptian
nomes which took the names of the animals there
revered as images of the patron gods. That opinion
is consistent with the view expressed by M. Pierret as
to the character of the Egyptian deities. Dr. M’Lennan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
supposes,<a id="FNanchor_333_333" href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> however, that the heavenly bodies were
conceived as gods before the anthropomorphic gods
appeared. He argues that, as there is nothing in the
grouping of the stars to suggest animal forms, and as
stars, when named, were given names that commanded
respect, if not veneration, “the animals whose names
were transferred to the stars or Stellar groups, were
on earth highly, if not religiously, regarded,” in support
of which view he shows that nearly all the animals so
honoured were anciently worshipped as gods. It by
no means follows, however, that these animals were
so worshipped before being transferred to the heavens;
and possibly this had nothing to do with any special
regard for such animals. Much depends on the origin
and object of the constellations. There is still great
uncertainty on this point, but it is probable that the
signs of the Zodiac, at least, were supposed to represent
certain cosmical phenomena connected with the progress
of the seasons, or with day and night, half of
the signs being diurnal and masculine, and the other
half being nocturnal and feminine.<a id="FNanchor_334_334" href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">334</a></p>

<p>In a very suggestive work by Mr. Andrew Lang, it
is said<a id="FNanchor_335_335" href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">335</a> that Dr. M’Lennan gave up his hypothesis
and ceased to have any view on the origin of
totemism, and that its origin and determining causes
are still unknown. Mr. Lang himself suggests a
probable origin when he says,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span> “people united by
contiguity, and by the blind sentiment of kinship not
yet brought into explicit consciousness, might mark
themselves by a badge, and might thence devise a
name, and later might invent a myth of their descent
from the object which the badge represented;” the
meaning of which appears to be that, before blood
relationship was recognised, persons living together
marked<a id="FNanchor_336_336" href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> themselves to enable their common origin to
be remembered. Mr. Lang adds, however, that “the
very nature of totemism shows that it took its present
shape at a time when men, animals, and plants were
conceived of as physically akin; when names were
handed on through the female line; when exogamy
was the rule of marriage, and when the family theoretically
included all persons bearing the same family
name, that is, all who claimed kindred with the same
plant, animal, or object, whether the persons are
really akin or not.” According to this view, kinship
was fully recognised when totemism was established;
as descent in the female line is based on that recognition,
and exogamy was the result of the objection
entertained by the lower races to the intermarriage of
persons nearly related by blood or adoption. This
feeling could hardly be so strong when totemism
took its present shape, which is probably its original
shape, if, when totems were invented, kinship was not
recognised. The very nature of the totem is the
conception of a special relation between men and
certain animals and plants, and it is this conception,
together with that of the totem as a protecting influence,
which have to be explained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span></p>

<p>According to Sir John Lubbock,<a id="FNanchor_337_337" href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">337</a> totemism is the
stage of human progress in which natural objects,
trees, lakes, stones, animals, &amp;c., are worshipped,
and it is regarded as equivalent to <i>nature-worship</i>.
Totemism, again,<a id="FNanchor_338_338" href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">338</a> is the deification of classes, so that
“the Redskin who regards the bear, or the wolf, as
his totem, feels that he is in intimate, though mysterious,
association with the whole species.” The
explanation given by Sir John Lubbock<a id="FNanchor_339_339" href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> of the phase
of totemism which relates to the worship of animals
is, that it originated “from the practice of naming,
first individuals, and then their families, after particular
animals. A family, for instance, which was
called after the bear, would come to look on that
animal first with interest, then with respect, and at
length with a sort of awe.” This does not go far
enough, however, as it is not shown why certain
animals and other objects are chosen as totems, or
why such totems are not only viewed with veneration
but are regarded as friends and protectors. Dr. E. B.
Tylor well objects,<a id="FNanchor_340_340" href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">340</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span> “as to animal-worship, when we
find men paying distinct and direct reverence to the
lion, the bear, or the crocodile, as mighty superhuman
beings, or adoring other beasts, birds, or reptiles as
incarnations of spiritual deities, we can hardly supersede
such well-defined developments of animistic
religion, by seeking their origin in personal names of
deceased ancestors, who chanced to be called Lion,
Bear, or Crocodile.”</p>

<p>The fundamental basis of totemism is undoubtedly
to be found in that phase of human thought in which
spirits are supposed “to inhabit trees and groves,
and to move in the winds and stars,” and in which
almost every phase of nature is personified. But
whether, as asserted by Dr. M’Lennan,<a id="FNanchor_341_341" href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> “the animition
hypothesis, held as a faith, is at the root of all
the mythologies,” or whether the ideas of animism, as
found expressed in totemism, have been derived from
the doctrines of the ancient religions, is a question.
According to the religious philosophy of antiquity, as
expressed by Pythagoras, “the pure and simple essence
of the Deity, was the common source of all the forms of
nature, which, according to their various modifications,
possess different properties.” The Universe or Great
Cause, animated and intelligent, and subdivided into
a multitude of partial causes likewise intelligent, was
divided also into two great parts, the one active and
the other passive. Of these parts, the active comprises
the Heavens, and the passive the Earth and the
elements. In addition to this division was another,
that of principles, of which one, answering to the
active cause, was the principle of light or good, and
the other, answering to the passive cause, was the
principle of darkness or evil.<a id="FNanchor_342_342" href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">342</a> A very practical form
of the ancient belief embodied in that philosophical
system was entertained by the early Scandinavians,
who, says Mallet,<a id="FNanchor_343_343" href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> supposed that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span> “from the supreme
divinity emanated an infinity of inferior deities and
spirits, of whom every visible part of the universe
was the residence and the temple, which intelligences
not only dwell in them, but also direct their
operations. Each element had its intelligence or
proper deity; the Earth, the Water, the Fire, the Air,
the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars. It was contained
also in the trees, the forests, the rivers, the mountains,
the rocks, the winds, the thunder, the tempest, which
therefore deserved religious worship.” There is no
reference here to the twofold division of nature, but
it is found in the analogous beliefs of early races.
Thus, Lenormant, in his work on “Chaldean Magic
and Sorcery,”<a id="FNanchor_344_344" href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">344</a> when comparing the Finnish and
Accadian Mythologies, speaks of their having “the
same principle of the personification of natural
phenomena, objects, and classes of beings belonging
to the animated world.” An idea of dualism, however,
pervaded this system, which supposed that there
was “a bad as well as a good spirit attached to each
celestial body, each element, each phenomenon, each
object, and each being,” which were ever trying to
supplant each other.<a id="FNanchor_345_345" href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">345</a> Thus, both Accadians and
Finns “recognised two worlds at enmity with each
other; that of the gods together with the propitious
spirits, and that of the demons, respectively the kingdom
of light and that of darkness, the region of good
and that of evil.”<a id="FNanchor_346_346" href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">346</a></p>

<p>At first sight these ideas have no special bearing on
the subject of totemism, but it is different when we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
consider certain notions entertained by the Australian
aborigines.</p>

<p>The Rev. Lorimer Fison remarks,<a id="FNanchor_347_347" href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> “the Australian
totems have a special value of their own. Some of
them divide not mankind only, but the whole universe,
into what may almost be called gentile divisions.”
The natives of Port Mackay, in Queensland,
allot everything in nature into one or other of the
two classes, Wateroo and Yungaroo, into which their
tribe is divided. The wind belongs to one and the
rain to the other. The Sun is Wateroo and the Moon is
Yungaroo. The stars are divided between them, and
the division to which any star belongs can be pointed
out. The Mount Gambier tribe of South Australia
has a similar arrangement, but natural objects are
allied with the totemic subdivisions. Mr. Fison gives
examples of this as supplied to him by Mr. D. S.
Stewart, from which it appears that rain, thunder,
lightning, winter, hail, clouds, &amp;c., are associated with
the crow totem, and the stars, moon, &amp;c., belong to
the same totemic class as the black cockatoo; while
the black, crestless cockatoo subdivision includes the
sun, summer, autumn, wind, &amp;c. The native of South
Australia thus “looks upon the Universe as a Great
Tribe, to one of whose divisions he himself belongs;
and all things, animate and inanimate, which belong
to his class, are parts of the body corporate whereof
he himself is part.”</p>

<p>There is a curious parallelism between this system
and the ancient doctrine of the separation of the intelli<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>gent
Universe into two great divisions, the celestial and
terrestrial, or that of light and that of darkness. In
the totemic system one great division includes the sun
and summer, answering to the realm of light, and the
other division comprises moon, stars, winter, thunder,
clouds, rain, hail, answering to the realm of darkness.
The American aborigines also show traces of the
notion of the dual division of nature in their hero-myths,
which, according to Dr. Brinton,<a id="FNanchor_348_348" href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">348</a> are intended
to express “the daily struggle which is ever
going on between Day and Night, between Light
and Darkness, between Storm and Sunshine.” It is
not improbable that the American totem system is
based on the idea of duality. Although the totem
divisions or gentes are now so numerous, there is
no reason to believe that, as long since mentioned by
Lafitau<a id="FNanchor_349_349" href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">349</a> in relation to the Iroquois and Hurons, that
they had at one time not more than three gentes.
Mr. Morgan states, indeed, that the Iroquois commenced
with two gentes, and it is possible that the
original totems of all the North Americans were only
two in number. The Wolf and the Bear, which probably
answer to Light and Darkness,<a id="FNanchor_350_350" href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> are the only
totems common to all the great families of tribes of
that area.</p>

<p>The dualism of the American mythology possesses
the element of antagonism between the powers of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
light and those of darkness, which was met with in
the ancient mythologies. The Australian dualism
appears to lose sight of that opposition, and to look
upon the two great divisions of nature represented by
light and darkness as forming parts of a great whole.
This idea is not wanting, however, to one phase of
what Lenormant terms the “naturalistic pantheism”
of ancient religions. The French historian states<a id="FNanchor_351_351" href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">351</a> that,
although the Magi “preserved the dualistic form
which the old Proto-Medic religion must have admitted,”
yet they considered the antagonism between
the good and the bad spirits to be only superficial,
“for they regarded the representatives of the two
opposing principles as consubstantial, equal in power,
and emanating both from one and the same pre-existent
principle.” Lenormant finds traces of this
notion in the old Accadian system, and he affirms<a id="FNanchor_352_352" href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">352</a>
that Magism goes further than the perception of a
common principle from which both the evil and the
good principles emanated, seeing that it did not bind
itself to the worship of the latter, but rendered equal
homage to the two principles. This fact has an important
bearing on the worship of the Evil Being
so prevalent among the lower races, in combination
with the simple recognition of the existence of a
Good Being.</p>

<p>What has been said throws great light on the fundamental
ideas of totemism, but it does not account
for the notion of protection, which forms the real
practical feature of that system. This notion can,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
however, be found in certain doctrines of the
ancient Persian religion. Dr. M’Lennan refers,<a id="FNanchor_353_353" href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">353</a> in
support of his hypothesis, that animal gods were prolongations
of the totems, to the opinion said to have
been entertained by the Peruvians, that “there was
not any beast or bird upon the earth whose shape or
image did not shine in the heavens, by whose influence
its similitude was generated on the earth, and its
species increased.” From this he assumes “that the
celestial beings were conceived to be in <i>the shape</i> of
the animals, and to have special relations to their
breed on the earth.” The Peruvian notion is, however,
rather a phase of the ancient belief, expressed
in the cosmogony of Zoroaster, that all things on earth
had celestial prototypes which emanated from the
Deity. As Lenormant remarks,<a id="FNanchor_354_354" href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">354</a> “stars, animals, men,
angels themselves—in one word, every created being
had his Fravishi, who was invoked in prayers and
sacrifices, and was the invisible protector who watched
untiringly over the being to whom he was attached.”
The Mazdian <i>fravishis</i> answer to the personal spirits
of nature-worship, and, according to the Accadian
Magical Table, every man had “from the hour of his
birth a special god attached to him, who lived as his
protector and his spiritual type.”<a id="FNanchor_355_355" href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">355</a> We have here the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
idea of guardianship by a mysterious being which is so
important in connection with the totem, but there is
no suggestion that the <i>fravishi</i> itself ever became embodied
in a terrestrial form, although there does not
appear to be any reason why it should not do so.</p>

<p>We have, in the doctrine of transmigration of souls,
however, a sufficient explanation of the special association
between a particular totem and the members
of the gens or family group to which it gives name.
According to that doctrine,<a id="FNanchor_356_356" href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">356</a> as stated in the Hindoo
code, known as the Laws of Menu (chap. xii.), “with
whatever disposition of mind a man shall perform in
this life any act, religious or moral, in a future body
endued with the same quality, shall he receive his
retribution.” Numerous animals are named as proper
for such re-incarnation, and even vegetables and
mineral substances appear among them. Transmigration
seems to have been considered by Oriental teaching
essential to the attainment of perfection by the
human soul, and the forms through which it is supposed
to pass, include not only beasts, birds, and
fishes, but also trees, stones, and other inanimate
objects. The great Gautama himself is said to have
passed through all the existences of earth, air, and sea,
as well as through all the conditions of human life,
before he became the Buddha. Dr. M’Lennan says<a id="FNanchor_357_357" href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">357</a>
it is of the essence of the doctrine of transmigration
that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span> “everything has a soul or spirit, and that the
spirits are mostly human in the sense of having once
been in human bodies.” We have here the key to the
problem of totemism, which receives its solution in the
idea that the totem is <i>the re-incarnated form of the
legendary ancestor of the gens or family group allied to
the totem</i>. The belief that the spirits of the dead do
take on themselves animal forms is widely spread.<a id="FNanchor_358_358" href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">358</a>
The most remarkable example of this belief is that
which views certain snakes, not merely as re-incarnations
of human souls, but as re-embodiments of ancestors
of the people by whom such snakes are venerated.
Serpent-worship is, indeed, closely connected with the
worship of ancestors. The followers of the serpent
believed themselves “to be of the serpent-breed,
derived from a serpent ancestor,” and we know that
peoples have claimed to belong to the serpent race.
Such a claim, or that to a monkey relationship
made by some of the dark tribes of India, would be
readily admitted by the savage mind, and it may be
explained on the principle that the legendary ancestor
of the race is supposed to have become re-incarnated
in monkey or snake form, and that monkeys or
snakes as well as men are his descendants.</p>

<p>At the same time it is very probable that some
savages do not distinguish between the man and the
animal incarnation, and that if they think at all of the
ancestor of the race, it is under the animal form. It
must be remembered, however, that what to us is a
monkey or a bear is to the uncultured mind an incarnate
spirit, and it is this spirit-existence which is
referred to when men speak of their ancestors as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
animals or plants. This explanation is applicable also
to the case where descent is claimed from one of the
heavenly bodies. Particular stars are often identified
with persons who, distinguished while on earth, are
thought to be no less distinguished after death. The
spirit of the dead person thus becomes identified with
the star. When, therefore, a man or family claims
the Sun or the Moon as an ancestor, the spirit of the
luminary is really referred to. In fact, to the lower
races the Sun and the Moon are great beings, and
there is no apparent reason to them why a great man
should not be descended from the spirit of the Sun or
Moon, or after death be identified as that spirit.
Perhaps, when the Egyptian Monarch was called
Pharaoh, he was thought to be actually a descendant
of Phra, the Sun.<a id="FNanchor_359_359" href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">359</a> Such may have been the case also
with the Incas and other royal families who have
claimed to be of solar descent. Whether the Sun
was regarded as the great ancestor of the race, or only
as the re-embodiment of his spirit, it would be an
equally powerful totem, a remark which applies as
well to the Moon or other heavenly bodies. In
ancient times the Solar and Lunar races were very
powerful in the East, and their representatives are still
to be found in India among the Rajpoots and Jats.<a id="FNanchor_360_360" href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">360</a>
In ancient philosophy, the Sun and the Moon would
represent the two realms of Light and Darkness, into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
which the visible Universe was divided, and as totems
they probably stood at first in the same relation to
other totems as those of the Australian primary classes
stand to the totems of the secondary groups or gentes.
It is known that various animals were anciently associated
with the Sun or the Moon, or were venerated
as emblems of the Solar or Lunar Deity. Thus, the
Lion, the Bull, the Horse, the Elephant, the Monkey,
the Ram, and the Eagle, with others, were solar
animals; while, among other animals, the Cow, the
Hare, the Dog, the Beaver, the Dove, and the Fish,
were lunar animals.<a id="FNanchor_361_361" href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">361</a> An example of the process by
which certain creatures became associated with those
heavenly bodies is noted by Macrobius, who says of
the Lion, “this beast seems to derive his own nature
from the Sun, being, in force and heat, as superior to
all other animals as the Sun is to the Stars.” Another
example, but of a different character, and taken from
a very different quarter, may be cited.</p>

<p>The Mount Gambier tribe of South Australia, as we
have already seen, divides everything in nature between
two great classes, and although Mr. Stewart, who is
responsible for the information, could not find any
reason for the arrangement, it appears from his remarks
that the natives knew to which division any
object belongs. Mr. Stewart asked what division a
bullock belongs to. The answer was, “It eats grass,
it is Bourtwerio.” He then said, “A Crayfish does
not eat grass: Why is it Bourtwerio?” but the only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
reply he could get was, “That is what our fathers
said it was.”<a id="FNanchor_362_362" href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">362</a></p>

<p>We are now able to qualify the definition previously
given of the totem as a “badge of fraternity,”
or the “symbol of a gens.” We see that the totem
is something more than a symbol or a badge.
This description might answer for the pictorial representation
of the totem, but not for the totem itself,
which is regarded as having actual vitality as the
embodiment or re-incarnation of an ancestral spirit.
Any object is fitted for this spirit embodiment, and
therefore totemism may be looked upon, not as a
phase of nature-worship, but as a combination of this
religion with ancestor-worship. The ancestral character
of the totem accounts for the association with it
of the idea of protection, which is based on the
existence of a fraternal relationship between the
totem and all the individuals belonging to a particular
group of kin. The totem, as a badge or
symbol, therefore represents the group of individuals,
dead or alive, towards whom a man stands in a
fraternal relation, and the protection of whom he is
therefore entitled to, so long as he performs all the
obligations on his part which flow from the existence
of that relationship. The ideas embodied in the
totem are no doubt more ancient than totemism as a
developed social institution. This fact will furnish
an answer to the objection that totemism is known
only to peoples of a low degree of culture, who can
hardly be supposed capable of rising to the con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>ception
of nature, as a whole, on which that system is
founded, or the idea of a relationship existing between
all the objects in nature.</p>

<p>Dr. Brinton<a id="FNanchor_363_363" href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">363</a> answers those who object that the
cosmogonical myth of the Algonkins is “too refined
for those rude savages, or that it smacks too much
of reminiscences of old-world teachings,” that “it is
impossible to assign to it other than an indigenous
and spontaneous origin in some remote period of
Algonkin tribal history.” The same reply may be
given in relation to the universal totemism of the
Australians, with the qualification that the tribal
history of this race would have to be carried back to
a period when it was in contact, on the Asiatic Continent,
with peoples among whom originated or developed
the ideas on which totemism is based, if, indeed,
they did not belong with them to a common stock.
The existence among the natives of Australia and
America of that system may have been due to the
establishment of the gentile institution on the basis of
female kinship, and the intermingling of the gentes or
family groups, owing to wives leaving their own kin
on marriage to live among their husband’s kin,
as the result of the practice of exogamy. Some of
the Australian tribes have a legend according to which
the use of totems was introduced, by command of the
Supreme Being, to put a stop to consanguineous marriages.
This shows that the totem was connected with
marriage and kinship, but, considering how universal
is the objection among savages to marriage between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
near relations, it is more than probable that the legend
was formed to explain an already existing phenomenon,
that of totemism. As the conditions of
social life were changed, totemism as a system would
gradually become effete, and totems would come to
be regarded chiefly as curiosities of nomenclature.
The preference for kinship through males, in connection
with the tracing of descent, over kinship
through females, combined with the practice of wives
leaving their own family to live among their husband’s
kin, would take from the totem one of its most important
uses, as all the members of a “family” would
dwell together instead of being, like the individuals
belonging to the American or Australian totems,
intermingled in one group. Totems would then be
useful chiefly as ensigns, or as surnames to establish
community of descent, and therefore the evidence of
marriage disability; as with the Chinese, among
whom no persons of the same family name can intermarry,
however distant may be the actual relationship.
When the mere possession of a common surname was
no longer an absolute bar to intermarriage, and kinship
came to be traced equally through both parents,
totemism ceased to have any value, except so far as
the study of its phenomena can throw light on the
constitution and habits of ancient society.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a><br />

<small>MAN AND THE APE.</small></h2>


<p>The primary object of the present essay is to ascertain
whether the conclusion arrived at by Mr. Darwin
and other writers as to the origin of man—that he
has sprung from the ape by simple descent—can be
depended on, and if not, what is the nature of man’s
relationship to the animal kingdom.</p>

<p>Without further preface, I shall proceed to consider
as briefly as possible the main arguments adduced by
Mr. Darwin in support of this conclusion.<a id="FNanchor_364_364" href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">364</a> Those
which are derived from the consideration of physical
data appear to me to be of comparatively small
importance, since they may be admitted without
seriously affecting the question at issue. They are
almost all connected with the fact that man is “constructed
on the same general type or model with
other mammals.” Thus it is with the brain, every
chief fissure and fold of which is declared to be
developed in the brain of the orang equally with that
of man. Their constitutional habit, however, appears
also to be the same. Thus man and monkeys are
liable to many of the same non-contagious diseases;
medicines produce the same effect on both, and most
mammals exhibit the mysterious law of periodicity in
various diseases. These are interesting facts, but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
most important for the argument of the ape-descent
of man are those which show the existence in the
human body of certain rudimentary organs and structures
which are fully developed with some of the
lower animals. It is possible, however, to explain
this phenomenon without having recourse to the
hypothesis of a simple ape-descent; even if it be admitted
with M. Broca, that in the parallel between
man and the anthropoids, the comparison of organs
shows only some slight differences.<a id="FNanchor_365_365" href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">365</a> This may be
granted even as to the brain, and that “the immense
superiority of man’s intelligence depends, not on the
anatomical structure of his brain, but on its volume
and power.”<a id="FNanchor_366_366" href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">366</a> But then, if such is the case, it is all
the more difficult to account for the vast difference
which, says Broca, a comparison of function reveals,
and which led M. Gratiolet to exclaim that, although
man is indeed by his structure a monkey, yet by his
intelligence he is a God.<a id="FNanchor_367_367" href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">367</a></p>

<p>While admitting that physiological considerations
reveal a much wider interval between man and the
anthropoid apes than anatomical data require, M. Broca
would hardly allow that the former exhibits anything
peculiar in his mental action. So, also, Mr. Darwin
says that man and the higher mammals “have some
few instincts in common. All have the same senses,
intuitions, and sensations—similar passions, affections,
and emotions, even the more complex ones; they feel
wonder and curiosity; they possess the same faculties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
of imitation, attention, memory, imagination, and
reason, though in very different degrees.”<a id="FNanchor_368_368" href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">368</a> The faculty
of articulate speech, moreover, is said not in itself to
offer “any insuperable objection to the belief that
man has been developed from some lower form;”
while the taste for the “beautiful” is shown not to be
peculiar to the human mind.<a id="FNanchor_369_369" href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">369</a> The moral sense is
supposed by Mr. Darwin to be the most distinctive
characteristic of man; but even this is asserted to
have been developed out of the social instincts which
man and many of the lower animals have in common.<a id="FNanchor_370_370" href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">370</a>
Finally, self-consciousness, abstraction, &amp;c., even if
peculiar to man, are declared to be “the incidental
results of other highly-advanced intellectual faculties;”<a id="FNanchor_371_371" href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">371</a>
and these again are mainly due to the continued use
of a highly-developed language, which originated in
“the imitation and modification, aided by signs and
gestures, of various natural sounds, the voices of other
animals and man’s own instinctive cries.”<a id="FNanchor_372_372" href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">372</a></p>

<p>If, however, all this be true, how are we to account
for the wonderful intellectual superiority of man?
Haeckel gives an explanation which, although ingenious,
is far from satisfactory. He says that it is owing
to the fact that “man combines in himself several
prominent peculiarities, which only occur separately
among other animals.” The most important of these
are the superior structure of the larynx, the degree of
brain or soul development, and that of the extremities,
the upright walk, and, lastly, speech. But, says<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
Haeckel, “all these prerogatives belong singly to
other animals—birds with highly-organised larynx
and tongue, such as the parrot, &amp;c., can learn to utter
articulate sounds as perfectly as man himself. The
soul’s activity exists among many of the higher animals,
particularly with the dog, the elephant, and the horse,
in a higher degree of cultivation than with man when
most degraded. The hand, as a mechanical instrument,
is as highly developed among the anthropoid
apes as with the lowest men. Finally, man shares his
upright walk with the penguin and other animals,
while capacity for locomotion is more fully and more
perfectly developed among many animals than with
man.” Haeckel concludes, therefore, that it is “solely
the fortunate combination of a higher organisation of
several very important organs and functions which
raises most men, but not all, above the animals.”<a id="FNanchor_373_373" href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">373</a> This
explanation, however, appears rather to increase the
difficulty than to remove it. Some of Haeckel’s
statements might probably be challenged with success;
but even admitting their truth, what cause can be
given of the marvellous combination in man, of qualities
possessed separately by animals, the highest in the
class to which they belong?</p>

<p>Mr. Darwin justly remarks, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span> “the belief that
there exists in man some close relation between the
size of the brain and the development of the intellectual
faculties, is supported by the comparison of
the skulls of savage and civilised races of ancient and
modern peoples, and by the analogy of the whole
vertebrate series.”<a id="FNanchor_374_374" href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">374</a> There must, indeed, be a certain
agreement between the brain and its intellectual
products, and hence the large size of the human brain
requires that the mental phenomena of man should be
of a vastly superior nature to those presented by the
lower animals. Whether, according to the developmental
view of the correspondence between human and
brute mental faculties, the lower races of man, as
compared with animals, really exhibit an intellectual
superiority commensurate with the largeness of their
brains, may be questioned. Mr. Wallace, indeed,
declares that they do not, and he goes so far as to say
that “a brain slightly larger than that of the gorilla
would, according to the evidence before us, fully have
sufficed for the limited mental development of the
savage.”<a id="FNanchor_375_375" href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">375</a> This opinion is correct, on the assumption
that animal and human mental action is perfectly
analogous, and Mr. Wallace would undoubtedly be
right in asserting that the savage possesses a brain
“quite disproportionate to his actual requirements,”
if by this phrase is meant his mere animal wants.
But the savage is a man, and the size of brain required
by him must be judged of, not by the degree of
intellectual action he exhibits, but by its accompaniments—not
by quantity, but by quality.</p>

<p>The source of man’s superiority must be sought in
an examination of his mental faculties, and yet the
inquiry is vitiated at the very commencement, by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
assumption that the mind of man differs from that of
the animal only in the degree of its activity. I am
prepared to admit that the higher mammalia, at least,
have the power of reasoning, with all the faculties
which are essential to its exercise. But this very fact
makes it utterly incomprehensible how the result of
human mental activity can be so superior, unless some
further principle or faculty than those which the
animal mind possesses operates in that of man. What
this principle or faculty is, may be shown by reference
to certain facts connected with language. Mr. Darwin
ascribes the origin of human speech to imitation and
modification of natural sounds and man’s own instinctive
utterances.<a id="FNanchor_376_376" href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">376</a> That the primitive elements of
man’s language were thus obtained is doubtless true.
Something else, however, is required to explain the
phenomena presented by the languages of uncultured
peoples. Such, for instance, cannot have been the
origin of certain ideas which are apparently common
to the minds of all peoples however savage. It has
been said that these peoples, although having names
for every particular object, have no words to express
a class of objects. This statement must be received
with caution. But if absolutely true in the sense
intended, it cannot be denied that nearly all primitive
languages have words denoting colours, and these by
their very nature, as expressive of attributes, are
applicable to a series of objects.</p>

<p>Now there is not the slightest reason to believe that
animals have any idea of qualities, as such. Even the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
taste for the beautiful, which Mr. Darwin tells us is
not unknown to various animals—especially birds,
has relation to the object which attracts by its
colour, &amp;c., and not to the colour itself. But it is
just this perception of the qualities of objects which
is at the foundation, and forms the starting point, of
all human progress. The essential instrument of
intellectual development, articulate language, was first
prompted by such a perception, and it was in the
recognition of the qualities of actions, by reflection on
their consequences, that the moral sense was gradually
evolved. It can hardly be that a power which has
had so wonderful an effect, and one which is so
different from anything met with among the lower
animals, can be referred to any of the ordinary faculties
which these possess. If not, we must ascribe it to a
new faculty altogether, a kind of spiritual insight,
which can be explained only as resulting from the
addition of a principle of activity superior to that
which is the seat of the animal life. If we were to
trace the beginning of every single branch of human
culture, it would be found to have originated in the
exercise of such a faculty of reflection as that here
described. The elements of knowledge man possesses
in common with the animals around him; but
these have not built up any superstructure, because
they have no spiritual insight such as will enable
them to analyse those elements, and thus to fit them
for re-combination into that wonderful series of forms
which they have taken in the human mind.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to discuss here the nature of
the principle which thus shows its energy in the mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
of man. Whether it is the cause or the effect of the
refined organisation exhibited by the human body
need not now be considered. If the latter, however,
it may be objected that—assuming the human bodily
organism to have been derived by descent from a
lower animal form, according to the principles of
natural selection—the intellectual faculty peculiar to
man must have had analogous origin. To this it
might be answered that man’s special faculty could
not have been derived from an animal organism which
does not itself possess it; but it is advisable rather to
test that conclusion by a consideration of the physical
data, and to see how far the argument for natural
descent can be supported. According to this view,
the tendency to the bipedal character was the first to
become operative in the gradual development of man
out of the ape. The erect form is supposed, however,
to have been assumed that the arms and hands
might have full play,<a id="FNanchor_377_377" href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">377</a> and it is evident that the free
use of these would not have been of any special advantage
without an increased brain-activity to guide
them. Probably the changes required in the physical
structure would be concomitant, but if they had a
starting point it would surely be in the brain rather
than in the extremities.</p>

<p>The great development of the encephalon in man
as compared with the monkey tribe would, in fact,
require all the other supposed changes. Thus the
greatly increased size and weight of the brain and its
bony case, combined with the position of the foramen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
magnum at the base of the skull, would necessitate
the erect position of the body, and this would supply
the arms and upper part of the trunk with the required
freedom of movement. These changes would be accompanied
by the modification of the pelvis and lower
limbs, while the increased sensitiveness of the skin,
resulting from man’s more refined nervous structure,
will sufficiently account for its general nakedness,<a id="FNanchor_378_378" href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">378</a>
without supposing, with Mr. Darwin, the influence of
sexual selection.<a id="FNanchor_379_379" href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">379</a> It is therefore in reality only the
large size of the human brain that has to be accounted
for, and this is by no means easy on the principle of
natural selection. No doubt, with the increased activity
of the mental powers, the brain would become
more voluminous. But what was to determine that
increased activity? It can only have been an improvement
in the conditions of existence, to which
man’s supposed ape progenitors were subjected, for
which no sufficient reason can be given. Moreover,
those progenitors would be subjected to the inevitable
struggle for existence—a struggle which, even with
man, in an uncivilised state, has a tendency to brutalise
rather than to humanise. Under these conditions
it would seem to be impossible for man to have
raised himself to so great a superiority over his nearest
allies as even the lowest savage exhibits. “His absolute
erectness of posture, the completeness of his
nudity, the harmonious perfection of his hands, the
almost infinite capacities of his brain, constitute,” says<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
Mr. Wallace, “a series of correlated advances too
great to be accounted for by the struggle for existence
of an isolated group of apes in a limited area,”<a id="FNanchor_380_380" href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">380</a> as Mr.
Darwin’s hypothesis supposes.</p>

<p>While firmly convinced, on the grounds already
stated, that man cannot have been derived from the
ape by descent with natural selection, I am by no
means prepared to admit that he may not have been
so derived under other conditions. Although man
undoubtedly has a mental faculty of the utmost importance
which the animals do not possess, agreeing
with his superiority of physical structure, there can be
no question that, both physically and mentally, he is
most intimately allied to the members of the animal
kingdom. Before endeavouring to furnish a solution
of the difficult question of the origin of man under
these conditions, I would point out, what is so ably
insisted on by M. Broca,<a id="FNanchor_381_381" href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">381</a> that <i>transformism</i>, to use the
continental term, is wholly distinct from “natural
selection,” or any other mode by which the transformation
may be originated or effected. This is a most
important consideration, and one which Mr. Darwin
has incidentally referred to.<a id="FNanchor_382_382" href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> That man is the final
term in a process of evolution, the beginning of
which we cannot yet trace, appears to me to be a
firmly established truth. The descent of man from
the ape under the influence of external conditions is,
however, a totally different proposition, and one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
which no actual proof has yet been furnished, the
argument really amounting to this, that the correspondences
between man and the higher mammals render
it more likely that he has descended from the ape
than that he has been specially created. This may be
true, and yet those correspondences be owing to a
very different cause from the one thus supposed for
them.</p>

<p>Mr. Herbert Spencer affirms that “successive changes
of conditions would produce divergent varieties or
species” of the organisms subject to them, apart from
the influence of “natural selection,” which, in the
absence of such successive changes of conditions,
would effect “comparatively little.”<a id="FNanchor_383_383" href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">383</a> It is to the
latter especially Mr. Spencer traces the gradual evolution
of nature, on the process of which he has thrown
so much light. Thus, when treating elsewhere of that
evolution, he says, “While we are not called on to
suppose that there exists in organisms any primordial
impulse which makes them continually unfold into
more heterogeneous forms; we see that a liability to
be unfolded arises from the actions and reactions
between organisms and their fluctuating environments.
And we see that the existence of such a cause of development
pre-supposes the non-occurrence of development
where this fluctuation of actions and reactions does
not come into play.”<a id="FNanchor_384_384" href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">384</a> It is evident that this theory,
like that of Mr. Darwin, supposes the occurrence of
slight structural changes which, in the absence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
knowledge as to their exciting causes, may be described
as “spontaneous,” and the perpetuation of which is
the establishment of new forms or species. But
among domestic animals, and by analogy we may
assume, therefore, among wild animals, variation in
the way supposed is not the only mode by which the
physical structure may be modified. Various instances
of sudden change have been collected which are very
difficult to deal with, and they have led Mr. Huxley
to remark that Mr. Darwin’s position “might have
been even stronger than it is if he had not embarrassed
himself with the aphorism ‘<i>natura non facit saltum</i>,’
which turns up so often in his pages.” Mr. Huxley
adds “that nature does make jumps now and then,
and a recognition of the fact is of no small importance
in disposing of many minor objections to the doctrine
of transmutation.”<a id="FNanchor_385_385" href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">385</a> Minor objections may certainly
be thus removed, but only by introducing one of much
greater moment. If, as Mr. Spencer says, “natural
selection is capable of <i>producing</i> fitness between organisms
and their circumstances,”<a id="FNanchor_386_386" href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">386</a> it must be by the
perpetuation of slight changes, and there does not,
indeed, appear to be any room in the hypothesis of
natural selection for the saltatory movements which it
is so necessary to explain.</p>

<p>The changes which organisms undergo, whether
sudden or gradual, and whatever their approximate
exciting cause, take place in pursuance of the evolution
of organic nature, and there can be no doubt that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
this proceeds under the guidance of law. Professor
Owen expresses this fact in saying that “generations
do not vary accidentally in any and every direction,
but in preordained, definite, and correlated courses.”<a id="FNanchor_387_387" href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">387</a>
This may be accepted as expressing a general truth,
subject to some qualification of the word “preordained.”
It is not exactly true, however, for variations
are not always regular and orderly. Within
certain limits, indeed, they would seem to take place
in any direction, but there is always a tendency for
them to accumulate in that course along which they
meet with the least resistance. This is in accordance
with the principle laid down by Mr. Herbert Spencer,
that everything tends towards equilibration, the state
being one not of absolute but of moving equilibrium,
while “throughout evolution of all kinds there is a
continual approximation, and more or less complete
maintenance of this moving equilibrium.”<a id="FNanchor_388_388" href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">388</a> The
ultimate result is that, “when through a change of
habit or circumstance an organism is permanently
subject to some new influence, or different amount of
an old influence, there arises, after more or less disturbance
of the old rhythms, a balancing of them
around the new average conditions produced by this
additional influence.”<a id="FNanchor_389_389" href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">389</a> It is evident that the variations
which have been originated before the attainment
of the state of temporary stability thus established
would have little chance of being perpetuated;
and we have probably here the explanation of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
fact that the progress of evolution reveals itself so
often by sudden movements. In these cases, where
the disturbing influence has rendered the equilibrium
of the organism affected more or less unstable, a new
centre of equilibrium will be formed, and the appearance
of a fresh specific form be the result.</p>

<p>However fitted this explanation may be to account
for the gaps which so often present themselves in
developmental series of animal structures, it is far from
sufficient to account for the origin of man, at least on
the assumption of evolution governed merely by
mechanical principles. Neither man nor animals, in
fact, could have come into being at all unless there
had been an organic necessity, quite independent even
of the general average effects of the relations of
living bodies to their environments, insisted on by
Mr. Spencer. That these agencies have been very
influential in the evolution of organic nature is undoubtedly
true. But their influence in this respect
depends altogether on the organism on which they
act being in a condition of unstable equilibrium.
Mr. Spencer declares, when speaking of the condition
of homogeneity being a condition of unstable equilibrium,
that this instability is “consequent on the
fact that the several parts of any homogeneous aggregation
are necessarily exposed to different forces—forces
that differ either in kind or amount.”<a id="FNanchor_390_390" href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">390</a> This
may be true in relation to animal and vegetable forms,
whose germs are supposed not to show the slightest
trace of the future organism, although even as to these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
Mr. Spencer can say that “doubtless we are still in
the dark respecting those mysterious properties
which make the germ, when subject to fit influences,
undergo the special changes beginning this series of
transformations.”<a id="FNanchor_391_391" href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">391</a> But the unstable condition of the
primeval homogeneous substance of nature could not
be due to the cause assigned. For it requires the
impossible case of certain forces, the action of which
is supposed to result in the condition of instability,
existing <i>outside</i> of that substance which, as being
identified with the Absolute, we must assume to be
present throughout all space. The notion of an
universally diffused homogeneous substance, acted on
by external forces, appears to be contrary to reason;
and the proper explanation of the original condition
of instability would seem to be that it is natural to the
primeval substance as the result of an innate energy,
the internal force which constitutes its vitality. But
this substance cannot have been merely “material.”
There is just as little room for transition from the
inorganic to the organic as from the animal to man;
there is but one satisfactory starting-point—nature
itself viewed as organic.</p>

<p>If such is the case when the changes observable in
nature are viewed as strictly evolutional, much more
so is it when they are traced to the lower activity of
natural selection. Mr. J. J. Murphy well remarks
that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span> “the facts of variability being the greatest in the
lowest organisms, while progress has been most rapid
among the higher ones, shows that there is something
in organic progress which mere natural selection
among spontaneous variations will not account for.”<a id="FNanchor_392_392" href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">392</a>
Elsewhere the same writer declares that “no solution
of the questions of the origin of organisation and the
origin of organic species can be adequate which does
not recognise an organising intelligence over and
above the common laws of matter”—<i>i.e.</i>, the laws of
self-adaptation to circumstances and natural selection.<a id="FNanchor_393_393" href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">393</a>
This organising intelligence is supposed to
have been bestowed once for all on vitalised matter
by the Creator, so as to prevent the necessity of separately
organising each particular structure,<a id="FNanchor_394_394" href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">394</a> although
it is suggested that man’s spiritual nature may be a
direct result of creative power.<a id="FNanchor_395_395" href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">395</a> Mr. Wallace objects
to the law of “unconscious intelligence,” that “it has
the double disadvantage of being both unintelligible
and incapable of any kind of proof.”<a id="FNanchor_396_396" href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">396</a> This is true
enough, but it has the equally serious defect of reintroducing
the notion of special “creation,” with all
the difficulties attendant on the origin of matter, and
the separate existence of independent spiritual and
material substances.</p>

<p>Mr. Wallace himself is so much struck with the
imposing position occupied by man that he thinks
that “a superior intelligence has guided the development
of man in a definite direction and for a special
purpose, just as man guides the development of many
animal and vegetable forms.”<a id="FNanchor_397_397" href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">397</a> He supposes, more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>over,
that “the whole universe is not merely dependent
on, but actually <i>is</i>, the <span class="smcap lowercase">WILL</span> of higher intelligences,
or of one supreme intelligence.”<a id="FNanchor_398_398" href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">398</a> It seems to me,
although Mr. Wallace thinks otherwise, that this
notion completely undermines the hypothesis of
natural selection. If not only the whole universe,
but also a particular portion of it—man—has been
divinely “willed,” analogy will lead us to believe
that every other portion of the whole has thus
originated.</p>

<p>The difficulties attendant on theories such as those
of Mr. Murphy and Mr. Wallace, and the unsatisfactory
explanation afforded by the theory of evolution,
as usually understood, of the origin of man, have
led me to the opinion that nature as a whole is
organic, and that man is the necessary result of its
evolution. Not only so, however; man must be
viewed as the real object of the evolution of nature
viewed as a living organism. Without him nature
itself would be imperfect, and all lower animal forms
must, therefore, be considered as subsidiary to the
human organism, and as so many stages only towards
its attainment. But if living nature is an organic
whole, its several parts must be intimately connected.
Hence the numerous correspondences between man
and the higher mammals cannot be accidental or even
merely designed similarities. They betoken an actual
and intimate connection between the organisms presenting
them, and such an one as is consistent only
with a derivation of one from the other. This view<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
differs from that of Mr. Darwin, not in the fact of
man’s derivation from the ape, but in the mode and
conditions under which it has taken place. Derivation,
by virtue of an inherent evolutional impulse, is
totally different from simple descent, aided by natural
selection. In the latter case the appearance of man may
be described as in some sense accidental; in the
former, not only is it necessary, but it is that for
which all evolution has taken place, the only condition,
in fact, under which evolution was possible.</p>

<p>How far such a development of organic forms as I
have supposed is consistent with design is a difficult
question. It is apparent that when nature is conceived
of as forming an organic whole, the universe
becomes identified with the Absolute, of whose being
relative nature is merely an expression. But is not
the possession by relative existences of intellectual
faculties, and of the marvellous power of insight or
reflection, evidence that the same powers belong also
to the absolute Being? The possession by man of
intelligence is, in fact, proof that organic nature is
intelligent. Still, however, the need of design is not
apparent. Granting that relative nature has been
evolved out of the absolute existence, such evolution
can have taken only one course—that which led to man,
who could appear only when the conditions of nature
were fitted for him, and who <i>must</i> appear when those
conditions were so fitted. Moreover, as man was
from the beginning the object of organic evolution,
this must have taken place along the line which led
to him, without any actually preconceived design or
intention other than that which is implied in the pre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>knowledge
of man’s appearance. It does not follow,
however, that other branches of organic nature
besides that which ended in man may not have
reached a stage of structural perfection. No doubt
they have so done, and thus we can understand how
it is that certain animals seem to have been, as Professor
Owen asserts, “predestined and prepared for
man.” The fitness pointed out by our great anatomist
“of the organisation of the horse and ass for the
needs of mankind, and the coincidence of the origin
of the Ungulates having equine modifications of the
perissodactyle structure with the period immediately
preceding, or coincident with, the earliest evidence of
the human race,” is certainly remarkable.<a id="FNanchor_399_399" href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">399</a> I cannot
see in these facts, however, anything more than a
necessary coincidence arising from the progress of
evolution along different planes. It is possible, however,
that Professor Owen may mean little more than
this, and that he would be satisfied to admit the
identity between the “predetermining” agent and
organic nature, acting by virtue of the laws of its own
evolutional impulse. So at least may be supposed
from the fact that he rejects “the principle of direct
or miraculous creation,” and recognises “a ‘natural
law or secondary cause’ as operative in the production
of species in orderly succession and progression.”<a id="FNanchor_400_400" href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">400</a> It
is difficult to understand how otherwise there could
be an “innate tendency to deviate from the parental
type.”</p>

<p>Before concluding, reference should be made to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
certain facts connected with the development of the
brain and the human organism generally, which at
first sight seem to be quite irreconcilable with the
notion of man’s derivation from the ape, even under
the conditions I have proposed. Thus, M. Pruner
Bey has shown that in man and the anthropomorphous
apes there exists “an <i>inverse order</i> of the final term of
development in the sensitive and vegetative apparatus,
and in the systems of locomotion and reproduction.”
The same inverse order is exhibited in the development
of individual organs. Thus it is, says Pruner
Bey, with a portion of the permanent teeth; Welcher
makes a similar remark as to the modifications of the
base of the skull in relation to the sphenoidal angle
of Virchow; and Gratiolet points out an analogous
fact in the development of the brain. The language
of the great French anatomist is very precise. He
says: “With man and the adult anthropormorphous
apes there exists a certain resemblance in the mode
of arrangement in the cerebral folds which has
imposed on some persons and on which they have
strongly insisted. But this result is attained <i>by an
inverse process</i> (<i>marche inverse</i>). In the monkey the
temporosphenoidal convolutions which form the
middle lobe appear and perfect themselves before the
anterior convolutions which form the frontal lobe.
With man, on the contrary, the frontal convolutions
appear the first, and those of the middle lobe show
themselves the last.” In referring to these facts, M. de
Quatrefages declares that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span> “when two organised beings
follow an inverse course in their development, the
more highly developed of the two cannot have
descended from the other by means of evolution.”<a id="FNanchor_401_401" href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">401</a>
If by evolution is meant simple descent under the
influence of natural selection and modification of
external conditions, this conclusion is certainly correct.
It is true that, contrary to the opinion expressed by
Gratiolet, that “the human brain differs the more
from that of the monkey the less it is developed, and
an arrest of development can only exaggerate this
natural difference.”<a id="FNanchor_402_402" href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">402</a> M. Carl Vogt declares that the
human brain may, under certain conditions, not only
externally resemble that of the higher apes, but also
that the superior portion of it (<i>parties voûtées</i>) in
microcephalic idiots is really developed after the
simian type,<a id="FNanchor_403_403" href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">403</a> the skull itself having both simian and
human elements.<a id="FNanchor_404_404" href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">404</a> But does not the fact that the
lower part of the microcephalic skull, and the portion
of the brain which is the earliest developed, are
formed on the human type, amply justify the assertion
of Gratiolet that “the microcephale, however degraded,
is not a brute, but only a modified man?” Is it not
evident, moreover, that however highly an ape brain
may be developed, it could not become like that of a
man, at least by descent with natural selection? It
is different, however, if we view man as the necessary
product of the evolution of organic nature. We may
well believe that when the sudden advance from the
ape structure to that of man was made, under the conditions
above proposed, the great increase in the size<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
of the brain and the change in the position of the foramen
magnum were accompanied by an alteration in the
order of development, not only of the different parts of
the brain, but also of the internal apparatus as pointed
out by M. Pruner Bey. But the advance having once
taken place, the human type can no more be lost; and
although the approach to the simian type which
appears in the abnormal microcephalic brain evidences
the intimate connection between man and the ape,
yet it furnishes no disproof of derivation, one from the
other, by the agency of internal evolutional impulse.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I would again refer to the fact, so
strongly insisted on by M. Broca, that the truth of
the theory of evolution is not dependent on that of
the hypothesis of natural selection. The great defect
of “natural selection” as an agent in organic evolution,
is that it cannot do more than perpetuate certain
structural peculiarities, the appearance of which it is
powerless to explain. The hypothesis is properly
defined as “natural selection among spontaneous
variations;” and it is the appearance of these variations
which constitutes the most important part of the
problem. They can be explained only on the assumption
of “an internal tendency to deviate from the
parental type;” and granting that this tendency
results from a necessary evolution of nature viewed
as an organic whole, there is no difficulty in accounting
for all the facts dwelt on by Mr. Darwin without
supposing the derivation of man from the ape by
simple descent, although not without identifying the
universe with Deity, and viewing its various manifestations
as His organs.</p>

Dr. Fernand Castelain, in his work, “La Circoncision est-elle
utile?” comes to the conclusion (p. 14) that it is both hygienic
and moral. The value of circumcision may be admitted, without
ascribing its origin to a sanitary motive.</p></div>

M. Elie Reclus, in a remarkable paper presented in 1879 to
the Anthropological Institute, affirms (p. 16, <i>et seq.</i>) that circumcision
is derived from the custom of emasculation practised on
captives, which is equivalent to death, and that it is a substitute
for human sacrifices. He admits, however (p. 32), that, among
the Semites at least, circumcision was a “consecration of the
sexual organ to a Phallic divinity.”</p></div>

nature, the life transmitted from generation to generation, or,
as Professor Stephens puts it, ‘life out of death, life everlasting.’”—<i>Snake

It may be objected that the “Boundehesch,” which gives
the above details, is comparatively a modern work. It must be
noted, however, that the destruction of purity in the world by the
serpent <i>Dahâka</i> is mentioned in the 9th Yaçna, v. 27, which is
much earlier, and that Dr. Haug supposes the “Boundehesch”
to have had a Zend original (“Essays on the Sacred Language,
&amp;c., of the Parsees,” p. 29). Windischmann, also, says that “a
closer study of this remarkable and venerable book, and comparing
it with the original text preserved to us, will induce us
to form a much more favourable opinion of its antiquity and
contents.” (“Zoroastrische Studien,” p. 282). The opinion of
this latter writer is that, notwithstanding the striking resemblance
between the narrative of the fall of man contained in the
“Boundehesch” and that in Genesis, the former is original,
although inferior in simplicity to the Hebrew tradition (<i>idem</i>, p.
212). The narratives are so much alike, however, that they
can hardly have had independent origins, and the very simplicity
of the latter is a very strong argument against its
priority.</p></div>

We must look to the esoteric teaching of Mithraism for the
origin and explanation of much of primitive Christian dogma.
The doctrine of “regeneration,” which is a spiritual application
of the idea of physical generation, was known to all the religious
systems of antiquity, and probably the Phallic emblems generally
used were regarded by the initiated as having a hidden meaning.
I may, perhaps, be allowed to refer to the second volume of my
“Evolution of Morality” for information on the subject of the
“re-birth.”</p></div>

In the philosophy of St. Paul, the death of Christ was
rendered necessary by the fall. By the first man, Adam, came
death, and in Christ the second Adam are all made alive. Mankind
reverts to the position occupied by Adam before he sinned;
and as in the New Jerusalem there is no marriage, so in the
earthly paradise of the Hebrew legend man was at first intended
to live alone.</p></div>

<i>Le Mythe de Votan</i>, by H. de Charencey, 1871, pp. 95, 103.
Gautama was only the last of the Boudhas, and the identification
of Woden is therefore not necessarily with Gautama. Dr.
Brinton, “in order to put a stop to such visionary etymologies”
as those which connect Votan with Wodan and Buddha, derives
Votan from a Maya radical (<i>American Hero-Myths</i>, 1882, p. 217).
It must be noted, however, that the Maya meaning of Votan
(heart <i>fig.</i> spirit) closely agrees with that of Wodan (mind) and
Buddha (knowledge).</p></div>

This idea survives in the personal patron saints of the Greek
Church. The special god was of a peculiar character, “partaking
of the imperfections and foibles of human nature,” and,
like the Mazdian <i>fravishi</i>, it was part of the man’s soul.
Lenormant says, however, that in the Mazdian books, “the
conception rose to a higher degree, detaching itself from the
materiality and imperfections of the terrestrial nature.”</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
